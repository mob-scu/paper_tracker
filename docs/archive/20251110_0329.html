<div class="mono">The rapid expansion of research on Large Language Model (LLM) safety and
robustness has produced a fragmented and oftentimes buggy ecosystem of
implementations, datasets, and evaluation methods. This fragmentation makes
reproducibility and comparability across studies challenging, hindering
meaningful progress. To address these issues, we introduce AdversariaLLM, a
toolbox for conducting LLM jailbreak robustness research. Its design centers on
reproducibility, correctness, and extensibility. The framework implements
twelve adversarial attack algorithms, integrates seven benchmark datasets
spanning harmfulness, over-refusal, and utility evaluation, and provides access
to a wide range of open-weight LLMs via Hugging Face. The implementation
includes advanced features for comparability and reproducibility such as
compute-resource tracking, deterministic results, and distributional evaluation
techniques. \name also integrates judging through the companion package
JudgeZoo, which can also be used independently. Together, these components aim
to establish a robust foundation for transparent, comparable, and reproducible
research in LLM safety.</div></details>

<details class="detail"><summary>Abstract</summary>
<div class="mono">The widespread deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) as public-facing
web services and APIs has made their security a core concern for the web
ecosystem. Jailbreak attacks, as one of the significant threats to LLMs, have
recently attracted extensive research. In this paper, we reveal a jailbreak
strategy which can effectively evade current defense strategies. It can extract
valuable information from failed or partially successful attack attempts and
contains self-evolution from attack interactions, resulting in sufficient
strategy diversity and adaptability. Inspired by continuous learning and
modular design principles, we propose ASTRA, a jailbreak framework that
autonomously discovers, retrieves, and evolves attack strategies to achieve
more efficient and adaptive attacks. To enable this autonomous evolution, we
design a closed-loop &quot;attack-evaluate-distill-reuse&quot; core mechanism that not
only generates attack prompts but also automatically distills and generalizes
reusable attack strategies from every interaction. To systematically accumulate
and apply this attack knowledge, we introduce a three-tier strategy library
that categorizes strategies into Effective, Promising, and Ineffective based on
their performance scores. The strategy library not only provides precise
guidance for attack generation but also possesses exceptional extensibility and
transferability. We conduct extensive experiments under a black-box setting,
and the results show that ASTRA achieves an average Attack Success Rate (ASR)
of 82.7%, significantly outperforming baselines.</div></details>

<details class="detail"><summary>Abstract</summary>
<div class="mono">Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in intelligent systems
that perform reasoning, summarization, and code generation. Their ability to
follow natural-language instructions, while powerful, also makes them
vulnerable to a new class of attacks known as prompt injection. In these
attacks, hidden or malicious instructions are inserted into user inputs or
external content, causing the model to ignore its intended task or produce
unsafe responses. This study proposes a unified framework for evaluating how
resistant Large Language Models (LLMs) are to prompt injection attacks. The
framework defines three complementary metrics such as the Resilience
Degradation Index (RDI), Safety Compliance Coefficient (SCC), and Instructional
Integrity Metric (IIM) to jointly measure robustness, safety, and semantic
stability. We evaluated four instruction-tuned models (GPT-4, GPT-4o, LLaMA-3
8B Instruct, and Flan-T5-Large) on five common language tasks: question
answering, summarization, translation, reasoning, and code generation. Results
show that GPT-4 performs best overall, while open-weight models remain more
vulnerable. The findings highlight that strong alignment and safety tuning are
more important for resilience than model size alone. Results show that all
models remain partially vulnerable, especially to indirect and direct-override
attacks. GPT-4 achieved the best overall resilience (RDR = 9.8 %, SCR = 96.4
%), while open-source models exhibited higher performance degradation and lower
safety scores. The findings demonstrate that alignment strength and safety
tuning play a greater role in resilience than model size alone. The proposed
framework offers a structured, reproducible approach for assessing model
robustness and provides practical insights for improving LLM safety and
reliability.</div></details>

<details class="detail"><summary>Abstract</summary>
<div class="mono">Identifying the vulnerabilities of large language models (LLMs) is crucial
for improving their safety by addressing inherent weaknesses. Jailbreaks, in
which adversaries bypass safeguards with crafted input prompts, play a central
role in red-teaming by probing LLMs to elicit unintended or unsafe behaviors.
Recent optimization-based jailbreak approaches iteratively refine attack
prompts by leveraging LLMs. However, they often rely heavily on either binary
attack success rate (ASR) signals, which are sparse, or manually crafted
scoring templates, which introduce human bias and uncertainty in the scoring
outcomes. To address these limitations, we introduce AMIS (Align to MISalign),
a meta-optimization framework that jointly evolves jailbreak prompts and
scoring templates through a bi-level structure. In the inner loop, prompts are
refined using fine-grained and dense feedback using a fixed scoring template.
In the outer loop, the template is optimized using an ASR alignment score,
gradually evolving to better reflect true attack outcomes across queries. This
co-optimization process yields progressively stronger jailbreak prompts and
more calibrated scoring signals. Evaluations on AdvBench and JBB-Behaviors
demonstrate that AMIS achieves state-of-the-art performance, including 88.0%
ASR on Claude-3.5-Haiku and 100.0% ASR on Claude-4-Sonnet, outperforming
existing baselines by substantial margins.</div></details>
<details class="detail"><summary>Summary / 总结</summary>
<div class="mono">The research addresses the critical need to identify vulnerabilities in large language models (LLMs) to enhance their safety, particularly focusing on the issue of jailbreaks where adversaries exploit weaknesses through crafted prompts. Previous methods relied on binary attack success rate signals or manually crafted scoring templates, which were limited by their sparsity and potential biases. The proposed approach, AMIS (Align to MISalign), introduces a meta-optimization framework that simultaneously evolves both jailbreak prompts and scoring templates through a bi-level structure, effectively addressing the shortcomings of earlier methods. This innovative methodology allows for fine-grained feedback in the inner loop and optimizes the scoring template in the outer loop, resulting in stronger prompts and more accurate scoring signals. The performance of AMIS has been validated on tasks such as AdvBench and JBB-Behaviors, achieving state-of-the-art results with an 88.0% attack success rate on Claude-3.5-Haiku and a perfect 100.0% on Claude-4-Sonnet, significantly surpassing existing benchmarks.</div>

<div class="mono">The rapid proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) has raised
significant concerns about their security against adversarial attacks. In this
work, we propose a novel approach to crafting universal jailbreaks and data
extraction attacks by exploiting latent space discontinuities, an architectural
vulnerability related to the sparsity of training data. Unlike previous
methods, our technique generalizes across various models and interfaces,
proving highly effective in seven state-of-the-art LLMs and one image
generation model. Initial results indicate that when these discontinuities are
exploited, they can consistently and profoundly compromise model behavior, even
in the presence of layered defenses. The findings suggest that this strategy
has substantial potential as a systemic attack vector.</div></details>

<div class="mono">With the integration of large language models (LLMs), embodied agents have
strong capabilities to understand and plan complicated natural language
instructions. However, a foreseeable issue is that those embodied agents can
also flawlessly execute some hazardous tasks, potentially causing damages in
the real world. Existing benchmarks predominantly overlook critical safety
risks, focusing solely on planning performance, while a few evaluate LLMs&#x27;
safety awareness only on non-interactive image-text data. To address this gap,
we present SafeAgentBench -- the first comprehensive benchmark for safety-aware
task planning of embodied LLM agents in interactive simulation environments,
covering both explicit and implicit hazards. SafeAgentBench includes: (1) an
executable, diverse, and high-quality dataset of 750 tasks, rigorously curated
to cover 10 potential hazards and 3 task types; (2) SafeAgentEnv, a universal
embodied environment with a low-level controller, supporting multi-agent
execution with 17 high-level actions for 9 state-of-the-art baselines; and (3)
reliable evaluation methods from both execution and semantic perspectives.
Experimental results show that, although agents based on different design
frameworks exhibit substantial differences in task success rates, their overall
safety awareness remains weak. The most safety-conscious baseline achieves only
a 10% rejection rate for detailed hazardous tasks. Moreover, simply replacing
the LLM driving the agent does not lead to notable improvements in safety
awareness. Dataset and codes are available in
https://github.com/shengyin1224/SafeAgentBench and

<details class="detail"><summary>Summary / 总结</summary>
<div class="mono">The research addresses the critical issue of safety in task planning for embodied agents powered by large language models (LLMs), as existing benchmarks primarily focus on planning performance while neglecting safety risks. Previous methods have either overlooked safety considerations or evaluated LLMs&#x27; safety awareness in non-interactive contexts, leading to a gap in understanding how these agents might perform hazardous tasks in real-world scenarios. The proposed SafeAgentBench is a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate safety-aware task planning in interactive environments, featuring a diverse dataset of 750 tasks that encompass various hazards and a universal environment for multi-agent execution. The methodology includes rigorous evaluation methods from both execution and semantic perspectives, revealing that current agents, despite differences in design, demonstrate weak safety awareness, with the best baseline achieving only a 10% rejection rate for hazardous tasks.

against these ALM-specific threats. To address this issue, we propose ALMGuard,
the first defense framework tailored to ALMs. Based on the assumption that
safety-aligned shortcuts naturally exist in ALMs, we design a method to
identify universal Shortcut Activation Perturbations (SAPs) that serve as
triggers that activate the safety shortcuts to safeguard ALMs at inference
time. To better sift out effective triggers while preserving the model&#x27;s
utility on benign tasks, we further propose Mel-Gradient Sparse Mask (M-GSM),
which restricts perturbations to Mel-frequency bins that are sensitive to
jailbreaks but insensitive to speech understanding. Both theoretical analyses
and empirical results demonstrate the robustness of our method against both
seen and unseen attacks. Overall, \MethodName reduces the average success rate
of advanced ALM-specific jailbreak attacks to 4.6% across four models, while
maintaining comparable utility on benign benchmarks, establishing it as the new
state of the art. Our code and data are available at

<div class="mono">The research addresses the vulnerabilities of Audio-Language Models (ALMs) that have emerged with recent advancements in multimodal understanding. Previous methods, which relied on defenses from traditional audio adversarial attacks or text-based Large Language Model jailbreaks, proved ineffective against ALM-specific threats.

<div class="mono">Existing training-time safety alignment techniques for large language models
(LLMs) remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks. Direct preference optimization
(DPO), a widely deployed alignment method, exhibits limitations in both
experimental and theoretical contexts as its loss function proves suboptimal
for refusal learning. Through gradient-based analysis, we identify these
shortcomings and propose an improved safety alignment that disentangles DPO
objectives into two components: (1) robust refusal training, which encourages
refusal even when partial unsafe generations are produced, and (2) targeted
unlearning of harmful knowledge. This approach significantly increases LLM
robustness against a wide range of jailbreak attacks, including prefilling,
suffix, and multi-turn attacks across both in-distribution and
out-of-distribution scenarios. Furthermore, we introduce a method to emphasize
critical refusal tokens by incorporating a reward-based token-level weighting
mechanism for refusal learning, which further improves the robustness against
adversarial exploits. Our research also suggests that robustness to jailbreak
attacks is correlated with token distribution shifts in the training process
and internal representations of refusal and harmful tokens, offering valuable
directions for future research in LLM safety alignment. The code is available

<details class="detail"><summary>Abstract</summary>
<div class="mono">Despite recent efforts in Large Language Model (LLM) safety and alignment,
current adversarial attacks on frontier LLMs can still consistently force
harmful generations. Although adversarial training has been widely studied and
shown to significantly improve the robustness of traditional machine learning
models, its strengths and weaknesses in the context of LLMs are less
understood. Specifically, while existing discrete adversarial attacks are
effective at producing harmful content, training LLMs with concrete adversarial
prompts is often computationally expensive, leading to reliance on continuous
relaxations. At the same time, despite their effectiveness and generalization
capabilities, training with continuous perturbations does not always capture
the full spectrum of vulnerabilities exploited by discrete attacks. In this
work, we aim to bridge this gap by introducing MixAT, a novel method that
combines stronger discrete and faster continuous attacks during training. We
rigorously evaluate MixAT across a wide spectrum of state-of-the-art attacks,
proposing the At Least One Attack Success Rate (ALO-ASR) metric to capture the
worst-case vulnerability of models. We show MixAT achieves substantially better
robustness (ALO-ASR &lt; 20%) compared to prior defenses (ALO-ASR &gt; 50%), while
maintaining a runtime comparable to methods based on continuous relaxations. We
further analyze MixAT in realistic deployment settings, exploring how chat
templates, quantization, low-rank adapters, and temperature affect both
adversarial training and evaluation, revealing additional blind spots in
current methodologies. Our results demonstrate that MixAT&#x27;s discrete-continuous
defense offers a principled and superior robustness-accuracy tradeoff with
minimal computational overhead, highlighting its promise for building safer
LLMs. We provide our code and models at

<details class="detail"><summary>Summary / 总结</summary>
<div class="mono">This research addresses the ongoing challenges in ensuring the safety and alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly in light of adversarial attacks that can lead to harmful outputs. Previous methods primarily focused on discrete adversarial training, which, while effective, proved to be computationally expensive and did not fully capture the vulnerabilities exploited by discrete attacks. The proposed MixAT method innovatively combines discrete and continuous adversarial training to enhance robustness while maintaining computational efficiency. The contribution of this paper lies in its introduction of the At Least One Attack Success Rate (ALO-ASR) metric, which effectively measures model vulnerability, and the demonstration that MixAT achieves significantly improved robustness (ALO-ASR &lt; 20%) compared to existing defenses (ALO-ASR &gt; 50%). This performance indicates that MixAT successfully meets its goals of enhancing LLM safety without incurring substantial computational costs.</div>

<div class="mono">As Large Language Models are rapidly deployed across diverse applications
from healthcare to financial advice, safety evaluation struggles to keep pace.
Current benchmarks focus on single-turn interactions with generic policies,
failing to capture the conversational dynamics of real-world usage and the
application-specific harms that emerge in context. Such potential oversights
can lead to harms that go unnoticed in standard safety benchmarks and other
current evaluation methodologies. To address these needs for robust AI safety
evaluation, we introduce SAGE (Safety AI Generic Evaluation), an automated
modular framework designed for customized and dynamic harm evaluations. SAGE
employs prompted adversarial agents with diverse personalities based on the Big
Five model, enabling system-aware multi-turn conversations that adapt to target
applications and harm policies. We evaluate seven state-of-the-art LLMs across
three applications and harm policies. Multi-turn experiments show that harm
increases with conversation length, model behavior varies significantly when
exposed to different user personalities and scenarios, and some models minimize
harm via high refusal rates that reduce usefulness. We also demonstrate policy
sensitivity within a harm category where tightening a child-focused sexual
policy substantially increases measured defects across applications. These
results motivate adaptive, policy-aware, and context-specific testing for safer
real-world deployment.</div></details>

<details class="detail"><summary>Abstract</summary>
<div class="mono">This paper presents a real-time modular defense system named Sentra-Guard.
The system detects and mitigates jailbreak and prompt injection attacks
targeting large language models (LLMs). The framework uses a hybrid
architecture with FAISS-indexed SBERT embedding representations that capture
the semantic meaning of prompts, combined with fine-tuned transformer
classifiers, which are machine learning models specialized for distinguishing
between benign and adversarial language inputs. It identifies adversarial
prompts in both direct and obfuscated attack vectors. A core innovation is the
classifier-retriever fusion module, which dynamically computes context-aware
risk scores that estimate how likely a prompt is to be adversarial based on its
content and context. The framework ensures multilingual resilience with a
language-agnostic preprocessing layer. This component automatically translates
non-English prompts into English for semantic evaluation, enabling consistent
detection across over 100 languages. The system includes a HITL feedback loop,
where decisions made by the automated system are reviewed by human experts for
continual learning and rapid adaptation under adversarial pressure.
Sentra-Guard maintains an evolving dual-labeled knowledge base of benign and
malicious prompts, enhancing detection reliability and reducing false
positives. Evaluation results show a 99.96% detection rate (AUC = 1.00, F1 =
1.00) and an attack success rate (ASR) of only 0.004%. This outperforms leading
baselines such as LlamaGuard-2 (1.3%) and OpenAI Moderation (3.7%). Unlike
black-box approaches, Sentra-Guard is transparent, fine-tunable, and compatible
with diverse LLM backends. Its modular design supports scalable deployment in
both commercial and open-source environments. The system establishes a new
state-of-the-art in adversarial LLM defense.</div></details>

<div class="mono">Despite recent advances, Large Language Models remain vulnerable to jailbreak
attacks that bypass alignment safeguards and elicit harmful outputs. While
prior research has proposed various attack strategies differing in human
readability and transferability, little attention has been paid to the
linguistic and psychological mechanisms that may influence a model&#x27;s
susceptibility to such attacks. In this paper, we examine an interdisciplinary
line of research that leverages foundational theories of persuasion from the
social sciences to craft adversarial prompts capable of circumventing alignment

hypothesize that LLMs, having been trained on large-scale human-generated text,
may respond more compliantly to prompts with persuasive structures.
Furthermore, we investigate whether LLMs themselves exhibit distinct persuasive

across multiple aligned LLMs reveal that persuasion-aware prompts significantly
bypass safeguards, demonstrating their potential to induce jailbreak behaviors.

<details class="detail"><summary>Abstract</summary>
<div class="mono">Finetuning large language models (LLMs) enables user-specific customization
but introduces critical safety risks: even a few harmful examples can
compromise safety alignment. A common mitigation strategy is to update the
model more strongly on examples deemed safe, while downweighting or excluding
those flagged as unsafe. However, because safety context can shift within a
single example, updating the model equally on both harmful and harmless parts
of a response is suboptimal-a coarse treatment we term static safety shaping.
In contrast, we propose dynamic safety shaping (DSS), a framework that uses
fine-grained safety signals to reinforce learning from safe segments of a
response while suppressing unsafe content. To enable such fine-grained control
during finetuning, we introduce a key insight: guardrail models, traditionally
used for filtering, can be repurposed to evaluate partial responses, tracking
how safety risk evolves throughout the response, segment by segment. This leads
to the Safety Trajectory Assessment of Response (STAR), a token-level signal
that enables shaping to operate dynamically over the training sequence.
Building on this, we present STAR-DSS, guided by STAR scores, that robustly
mitigates finetuning risks and delivers substantial safety improvements across
diverse threats, datasets, and model families-all without compromising
capability on intended tasks. We encourage future safety research to build on
dynamic shaping principles for stronger mitigation against evolving finetuning
risks. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/poloclub/star-dss.</div></details>

The contribution of the paper lies in the introduction of the Safety Trajectory Assessment of Response (STAR), which provides a token-level signal for dynamic shaping during training.

underlying risk concept space. Specifically, we decompose the latent risk
concept space into three mutually exclusive subspaces: the explicit risk
subspace (encompassing direct violations of safety guidelines), the implicit
risk subspace (capturing potential malicious content that requires contextual

<div class="mono">Recent research has shown that Large Language Models (LLMs) are vulnerable to
automated jailbreak attacks, where adversarial suffixes crafted by algorithms
appended to harmful queries bypass safety alignment and trigger unintended
responses. Current methods for generating these suffixes are computationally
expensive and have low Attack Success Rates (ASR), especially against
well-aligned models like Llama2 and Llama3. To overcome these limitations, we
introduce ADV-LLM, an iterative self-tuning process that crafts adversarial
LLMs with enhanced jailbreak ability. Our framework significantly reduces the
computational cost of generating adversarial suffixes while achieving nearly
100\% ASR on various open-source LLMs. Moreover, it exhibits strong attack
transferability to closed-source models, achieving 99\% ASR on GPT-3.5 and 49\%
ASR on GPT-4, despite being optimized solely on Llama3. Beyond improving
jailbreak ability, ADV-LLM provides valuable insights for future safety
alignment research through its ability to generate large datasets for studying

<details class="detail"><summary>Abstract</summary>
<div class="mono">Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing
but remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, especially multi-turn jailbreaks
that distribute malicious intent across benign exchanges and bypass alignment
mechanisms. Existing approaches often explore the adversarial space poorly,
rely on hand-crafted heuristics, or lack systematic query refinement. We
present NEXUS (Network Exploration for eXploiting Unsafe Sequences), a modular
framework for constructing, refining, and executing optimized multi-turn
attacks. NEXUS comprises: (1) ThoughtNet, which hierarchically expands a
harmful intent into a structured semantic network of topics, entities, and
query chains; (2) a feedback-driven Simulator that iteratively refines and
prunes these chains through attacker-victim-judge LLM collaboration using
harmfulness and semantic-similarity benchmarks; and (3) a Network Traverser
that adaptively navigates the refined query space for real-time attacks. This
pipeline uncovers stealthy, high-success adversarial paths across LLMs. On
several closed-source and open-source LLMs, NEXUS increases attack success rate
by 2.1% to 19.4% over prior methods. Code: https://github.com/inspire-lab/NEXUS</div></details>
<details class="detail"><summary>Summary / 总结</summary>
<div class="mono">This article addresses the vulnerability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to jailbreak attacks, particularly multi-turn jailbreaks that cleverly distribute malicious intent across seemingly benign interactions. Previous methods have struggled with inadequate exploration of the adversarial space, reliance on hand-crafted heuristics, and lack of systematic query refinement, leading to limited effectiveness. The proposed NEXUS framework offers a novel approach by integrating a structured semantic network for harmful intents, a feedback-driven simulator for iterative refinement, and a network traverser for adaptive navigation, thereby systematically enhancing attack strategies. The methodology demonstrates significant improvements in attack success rates, achieving increases of 2.1% to 19.4% over existing methods on various LLMs, thereby supporting the goal of more effective exploitation of vulnerabilities in multi-turn interactions.</div>

<div class="mono">We present a theoretical framework showing that popular LLM alignment
methods, including RLHF and its variants, can be understood as divergence
estimators between aligned (safe or preferred) and unaligned (harmful or less

We further show that using compliance-refusal datasets, rather than standard

<div class="mono">The increasing use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in agentic applications
highlights the need for robust safety guard models. While content safety in
English is well-studied, non-English languages lack similar advancements due to
the high cost of collecting culturally aligned labeled datasets. We present
CultureGuard, a novel solution for curating culturally aligned, high-quality

cultural data adaptation, machine translation, and quality filtering. This
pipeline enables the conversion and expansion of the
Nemotron-Content-Safety-Dataset-V2 English safety dataset into eight distinct

Llama-3.1-Nemotron-Safety-Guard-8B-v3 via LoRA-based fine-tuning. The final

LLMs to express their internal confidence in a way that is sufficiently

<details class="detail"><summary>Abstract</summary>
<div class="mono">Large language models (LLMs) can be prompted with specific styles (e.g.,
formatting responses as lists), including in malicious queries. Prior jailbreak
research mainly augments these queries with additional string transformations
to maximize attack success rate (ASR). However, the impact of style patterns in
the original queries that are semantically irrelevant to the malicious intent
remains unclear. In this work, we seek to understand whether style patterns
compromise LLM safety, how superficial style alignment increases model
vulnerability, and how best to mitigate these risks during alignment. We first
define ASR inflation as the increase in ASR due to style patterns in existing
jailbreak benchmark queries. By evaluating 32 LLMs across seven benchmarks, we
find that nearly all models exhibit ASR inflation. Notably, the inflation
correlates with an LLM&#x27;s relative attention to style patterns, which also
overlap more with its instruction-tuning data when inflation occurs. We then
investigate superficial style alignment, and find that fine-tuning with
specific styles makes LLMs more vulnerable to jailbreaks of those same styles.
Finally, we propose SafeStyle, a defense strategy that incorporates a small
amount of safety training data augmented to match the distribution of style
patterns in the fine-tuning data. Across three LLMs, six fine-tuning style
settings, and two real-world instruction-tuning datasets, SafeStyle
consistently outperforms baselines in maintaining LLM safety.</div></details>
<details class="detail"><summary>Summary / 总结</summary>
<div class="mono">The research addresses the vulnerability of large language models (LLMs) to malicious queries that exploit specific stylistic prompts, a concern that has emerged from prior jailbreak studies which primarily focused on augmenting queries with string transformations. Existing methods have not sufficiently examined how style patterns in original queries, which are irrelevant to the malicious intent, affect model safety. This paper contributes by defining the concept of ASR inflation, demonstrating that nearly all evaluated LLMs exhibit increased attack success rates due to style patterns, and revealing that superficial style alignment during fine-tuning exacerbates this vulnerability. The proposed methodology, SafeStyle, involves incorporating a small amount of safety training data that aligns with the stylistic distribution of fine-tuning data, and it shows improved performance across three LLMs and various fine-tuning settings, effectively enhancing LLM safety against jailbreak attempts.</div>

<div class="mono">Recent advancements in Large Language Model (LLM) safety have primarily
focused on mitigating attacks crafted in natural language or common ciphers
(e.g. Base64), which are likely integrated into newer models&#x27; safety training.
However, we reveal a paradoxical vulnerability: as LLMs advance in reasoning,
they inadvertently become more susceptible to novel jailbreaking attacks.
Enhanced reasoning enables LLMs to interpret complex instructions and decode
complex user-defined ciphers, creating an exploitable security gap. To study
this vulnerability, we introduce Attacks using Custom Encryptions (ACE), a
jailbreaking technique that encodes malicious queries with novel ciphers.
Extending ACE, we introduce Layered Attacks using Custom Encryptions (LACE),
which applies multi-layer ciphers to amplify attack complexity. Furthermore, we
develop CipherBench, a benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs&#x27; accuracy in
decoding encrypted benign text. Our experiments reveal a critical trade-off:
LLMs that are more capable of decoding ciphers are more vulnerable to LACE,
with success rates on gpt-oss-20b escalating from 60% under ACE to 72% with
LACE. These findings highlight a critical insight: as LLMs become more adept at
deciphering complex user ciphers--many of which cannot be preemptively included

<details class="detail"><summary>Abstract</summary>
<div class="mono">Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained significant traction in various
applications, yet their capabilities present risks for both constructive and
malicious exploitation. Despite extensive training and fine-tuning efforts
aimed at enhancing safety, LLMs remain susceptible to jailbreak attacks.
Recently, the emergence of multi-turn attacks has intensified this
vulnerability. Unlike single-turn attacks, multi-turn attacks incrementally
escalate dialogue complexity, rendering them more challenging to detect and
mitigate.
  In this study, we introduce G-Guard, an innovative attention-aware Graph
Neural Network (GNN)-based input classifier specifically designed to defend
against multi-turn jailbreak attacks targeting LLMs. G-Guard constructs an
entity graph for multi-turn queries, which captures the interrelationships
between queries and harmful keywords that present in multi-turn queries.
Furthermore, we propose an attention-aware augmentation mechanism that
retrieves the most relevant single-turn query based on the ongoing multi-turn
conversation. The retrieved query is incorporated as a labeled node within the
graph, thereby enhancing the GNN&#x27;s capacity to classify the current query as
harmful or benign. Evaluation results show that G-Guard consistently
outperforms all baselines across diverse datasets and evaluation metrics,
demonstrating its efficacy as a robust defense mechanism against multi-turn
jailbreak attacks.</div></details>
<details class="detail"><summary>Summary / 总结</summary>
<div class="mono">The research addresses the growing concern of jailbreak attacks on Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly focusing on the more complex multi-turn attacks that are harder to detect than single-turn ones. Previous methods have struggled to effectively mitigate these vulnerabilities, prompting the development of G-Guard, an attention-aware Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based input classifier. G-Guard improves upon existing approaches by constructing an entity graph that captures the relationships between queries and harmful keywords, along with an attention-aware augmentation mechanism that integrates relevant single-turn queries into the classification process. This methodology enhances the GNN&#x27;s ability to accurately classify queries as harmful or benign. The experimental results indicate that G-Guard significantly outperforms baseline models across various datasets and metrics, validating its effectiveness as a defense mechanism against multi-turn jailbreak attacks.</div>

<details class="detail"><summary>Abstract</summary>
<div class="mono">How should we evaluate the robustness of language model defenses? Current
defenses against jailbreaks and prompt injections (which aim to prevent an
attacker from eliciting harmful knowledge or remotely triggering malicious
actions, respectively) are typically evaluated either against a static set of
harmful attack strings, or against computationally weak optimization methods
that were not designed with the defense in mind. We argue that this evaluation
process is flawed.
  Instead, we should evaluate defenses against adaptive attackers who
explicitly modify their attack strategy to counter a defense&#x27;s design while
spending considerable resources to optimize their objective. By systematically
tuning and scaling general optimization techniques-gradient descent,
reinforcement learning, random search, and human-guided exploration-we bypass
12 recent defenses (based on a diverse set of techniques) with attack success
rate above 90% for most; importantly, the majority of defenses originally
reported near-zero attack success rates. We believe that future defense work
must consider stronger attacks, such as the ones we describe, in order to make
reliable and convincing claims of robustness.</div></details>
<details class="detail"><summary>Summary / 总结</summary>
<div class="mono">This research addresses the inadequacies in evaluating the robustness of language model defenses against jailbreaks and prompt injections, which are typically assessed using static attack strings or weak optimization methods. The authors propose a novel evaluation framework that focuses on adaptive attackers who modify their strategies to exploit specific defense mechanisms, thereby highlighting the limitations of existing methods. The paper contributes by demonstrating that systematic tuning of optimization techniques, including gradient descent and reinforcement learning, can successfully bypass 12 recent defenses with an attack success rate exceeding 90%, contrasting with the near-zero success rates previously reported. The methodology emphasizes the need for defenses to account for stronger, adaptive attacks to ensure their reliability and robustness in real-world scenarios.</div>

allow malicious users to solicit undesirable responses through manipulation of

<div class="mono">Most discussions about Large Language Model (LLM) safety have focused on
single-agent settings but multi-agent LLM systems now create novel adversarial
risks because their behavior depends on communication between agents and

pragmatic systems that have constrains such as limited token bandwidth, latency
between message delivery, and defense mechanisms. We design a
$\textit{permutation-invariant adversarial attack}$ that optimizes prompt
distribution across latency and bandwidth-constraint network topologies to
bypass distributed safety mechanisms within the system. Formulating the attack
path as a problem of $\textit{maximum-flow minimum-cost}$, coupled with the
novel $\textit{Permutation-Invariant Evasion Loss (PIEL)}$, we leverage
graph-based optimization to maximize attack success rate while minimizing
detection risk. Evaluating across models including $\texttt{Llama}$,
$\texttt{Mistral}$, $\texttt{Gemma}$, $\texttt{DeepSeek}$ and other variants on
various datasets like $\texttt{JailBreakBench}$ and

delineate the hierarchy and interplay among these values, enabling

Recently, the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has raised concerns
regarding their elusive intrinsic values. Despite growing efforts in

Existing adversarial attacks typically target harmful responses in single-point

<div class="mono">Conventional language model (LM) safety alignment relies on a reactive,
disjoint procedure: attackers exploit a static model, followed by defensive
fine-tuning to patch exposed vulnerabilities. This sequential approach creates
a mismatch -- attackers overfit to obsolete defenses, while defenders
perpetually lag behind emerging threats. To address this, we propose
Self-RedTeam, an online self-play reinforcement learning algorithm where an
attacker and defender agent co-evolve through continuous interaction. We cast
safety alignment as a two-player zero-sum game, where a single model alternates
between attacker and defender roles -- generating adversarial prompts and
safeguarding against them -- while a reward LM adjudicates outcomes. This
enables dynamic co-adaptation. Grounded in the game-theoretic framework of
zero-sum games, we establish a theoretical safety guarantee which motivates the
design of our method: if self-play converges to a Nash Equilibrium, the
defender will reliably produce safe responses to any adversarial input.
Empirically, Self-RedTeam uncovers more diverse attacks (+21.8% SBERT) compared
to attackers trained against static defenders and achieves higher robustness on
safety benchmarks (e.g., +65.5% on WildJailBreak) than defenders trained
against static attackers. We further propose hidden Chain-of-Thought, allowing
agents to plan privately, which boosts adversarial diversity and reduces
over-refusals. Our results motivate a shift from reactive patching to proactive
co-evolution in LM safety training, enabling scalable, autonomous, and robust
self-improvement of LMs via multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL).</div></details>

<div class="mono">Large Language Model (LLM) safety is one of the most pressing challenges for
enabling wide-scale deployment. While most studies and global discussions focus
on generic harms, such as models assisting users in harming themselves or
others, enterprises face a more fundamental concern: whether LLM-based agents
are safe for their intended use case. To address this, we introduce operational
safety, defined as an LLM&#x27;s ability to appropriately accept or refuse user
queries when tasked with a specific purpose. We further propose OffTopicEval,
an evaluation suite and benchmark for measuring operational safety both in
general and within specific agentic use cases. Our evaluations on six model
families comprising 20 open-weight LLMs reveal that while performance varies
across models, all of them remain highly operationally unsafe. Even the
strongest models - Qwen-3 (235B) with 77.77% and Mistral (24B) with 79.96% -
fall far short of reliable operational safety, while GPT models plateau in the
62-73% range, Phi achieves only mid-level scores (48-70%), and Gemma and
Llama-3 collapse to 39.53% and 23.84%, respectively. While operational safety
is a core model alignment issue, to suppress these failures, we propose
prompt-based steering methods: query grounding (Q-ground) and system-prompt
grounding (P-ground), which substantially improve OOD refusal. Q-ground
provides consistent gains of up to 23%, while P-ground delivers even larger
boosts, raising Llama-3.3 (70B) by 41% and Qwen-3 (30B) by 27%. These results
highlight both the urgent need for operational safety interventions and the
promise of prompt-based steering as a first step toward more reliable LLM-based
agents.</div></details>

<div class="mono">Large Language Models are fundamental actors in the modern IT landscape
dominated by AI solutions. However, security threats associated with them might
prevent their reliable adoption in critical application scenarios such as
government organizations and medical institutions. For this reason, commercial
LLMs typically undergo a sophisticated censoring mechanism to eliminate any
harmful output they could possibly produce. In response to this, LLM
Jailbreaking is a significant threat to such protections, and many previous
approaches have already demonstrated its effectiveness across diverse domains.
Existing jailbreak proposals mostly adopt a generate-and-test strategy to craft
malicious input. To improve the comprehension of censoring mechanisms and
design a targeted jailbreak attack, we propose an Explainable-AI solution that
comparatively analyzes the behavior of censored and uncensored models to derive
unique exploitable alignment patterns. Then, we propose XBreaking, a novel
jailbreak attack that exploits these unique patterns to break the security
constraints of LLMs by targeted noise injection. Our thorough experimental
campaign returns important insights about the censoring mechanisms and
demonstrates the effectiveness and performance of our attack.</div></details>

<div class="mono">Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress across a wide
range of tasks, but remain vulnerable to safety risks such as harmful content
generation and jailbreak attacks. Existing safety techniques -- including
external guardrails, inference-time guidance, and post-training alignment --
each face limitations in balancing safety, utility, and controllability. In
this work, we propose UpSafe$^\circ$C, a unified framework for enhancing LLM
safety through safety-aware upcycling. Our approach first identifies
safety-critical layers and upcycles them into a sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
structure, where the router acts as a soft guardrail that selectively activates
original MLPs and added safety experts. We further introduce a two-stage SFT
strategy to strengthen safety discrimination while preserving general
capabilities. To enable flexible control at inference time, we introduce a
safety temperature mechanism, allowing dynamic adjustment of the trade-off
between safety and utility. Experiments across multiple benchmarks, base model,
and model scales demonstrate that UpSafe$^\circ$C achieves robust safety
improvements against harmful and jailbreak inputs, while maintaining
competitive performance on general tasks. Moreover, analysis shows that safety
temperature provides fine-grained inference-time control that achieves the
Pareto-optimal frontier between utility and safety. Our results highlight a new

signal--models intrinsically &quot;know&quot; when to refuse. We introduce Safety
Instincts Reinforcement Learning (SIRL), which transforms this internal

threat. In this paper, aiming to bridge this gap, we explore the interpretable
mechanisms of LLM backdoors through Backdoor Attribution (BkdAttr), a
tripartite causal analysis framework. We first introduce the Backdoor Probe
that proves the existence of learnable backdoor features encoded within the
representations. Building on this insight, we further develop Backdoor
Attention Head Attribution (BAHA), efficiently pinpointing the specific
attention heads responsible for processing these features. Our primary
experiments reveals these heads are relatively sparse; ablating a minimal
\textbf{$\sim$ 3%} of total heads is sufficient to reduce the Attack Success
Rate (ASR) by \textbf{over 90%}. More importantly, we further employ these
findings to construct the Backdoor Vector derived from these attributed heads
as a master controller for the backdoor. Through only \textbf{1-point}
intervention on \textbf{single} representation, the vector can either boost ASR
up to \textbf{$\sim$ 100% ($\uparrow$)} on clean inputs, or completely
neutralize backdoor, suppressing ASR down to \textbf{$\sim$ 0% ($\downarrow$)}
on triggered inputs. In conclusion, our work pioneers the exploration of
mechanistic interpretability in LLM backdoors, demonstrating a powerful method
for backdoor control and revealing actionable insights for the community.</div></details>

<div class="mono">This article addresses the vulnerability of fine-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) to backdoor attacks via data poisoning, highlighting the lack of understanding of the internal mechanisms behind these attacks. Previous methods primarily focused on interpretability aspects such as alignment and hallucination, neglecting backdoor mechanisms, which complicates the elimination of these threats. The proposed approach, Backdoor Attribution (BkdAttr), introduces a tripartite causal analysis framework that includes a Backdoor Probe to identify learnable backdoor features and Backdoor Attention Head Attribution (BAHA) to isolate the specific attention heads responsible for these features. The research methodology demonstrates that ablating approximately 3% of total heads can reduce the Attack Success Rate (ASR) by over 90%, and the construction of a Backdoor Vector allows for significant control over the backdoor, achieving ASR manipulation from nearly 100% to approximately 0% with minimal intervention.

<div class="mono">As LLMs advance into autonomous agents with tool-use capabilities, they
introduce security challenges that extend beyond traditional content-based LLM
safety concerns. This paper introduces Sequential Tool Attack Chaining (STAC),
a novel multi-turn attack framework that exploits agent tool use. STAC chains
together tool calls that each appear harmless in isolation but, when combined,
collectively enable harmful operations that only become apparent at the final
execution step. We apply our framework to automatically generate and
systematically evaluate 483 STAC cases, featuring 1,352 sets of
user-agent-environment interactions and spanning diverse domains, tasks, agent
types, and 10 failure modes. Our evaluations show that state-of-the-art LLM
agents, including GPT-4.1, are highly vulnerable to STAC, with attack success
rates (ASR) exceeding 90% in most cases. The core design of STAC&#x27;s automated
framework is a closed-loop pipeline that synthesizes executable multi-step tool
chains, validates them through in-environment execution, and reverse-engineers
stealthy multi-turn prompts that reliably induce agents to execute the verified
malicious sequence. We further perform defense analysis against STAC and find
that existing prompt-based defenses provide limited protection. To address this
gap, we propose a new reasoning-driven defense prompt that achieves far
stronger protection, cutting ASR by up to 28.8%. These results highlight a
crucial gap: defending tool-enabled agents requires reasoning over entire

<div class="mono">Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing
with their ability to generate coherent and contextually relevant text.
However, their deployment raises significant concerns about the potential for
generating harmful or inappropriate content. In this paper, we introduce
Progressive Self-Reflection (PSR), a novel inference-time technique that
empowers LLMs to self-monitor and correct their outputs dynamically.
Experimental results demonstrate that applying our proposed method to
Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct reduces the attack success rate from 77.5\% to 5.9\%, to
Llama-3.1-8B base from 89.7\% to 5.6\%, and to Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct from 44.4\%
to 3.8\%, without additional training, while maintaining their original
performance on benign tasks. Our approach acts as a test-time scaling method,
where additional self-reflection rounds enhance safety at the cost of inference
overhead. To balance safety with computational efficiency, we introduce a
lightweight self-reflection predictor that estimates the optimal number of
reflection rounds based on input complexity. This adaptive mechanism prevents
unnecessary self-assessment on benign inputs while ensuring thorough evaluation
when encountering potentially harmful content. Our findings suggest that
Progressive Self-Reflection serves as a scalable test-time approach, enhancing
LLM safety by dynamically allocating computational resources in proportion to

<div class="mono">Large language models (LLMs) are now ubiquitous in everyday tools, raising
urgent safety concerns about their tendency to generate harmful content. The
dominant safety approach -- reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF)
-- effectively shapes model behavior during training but offers no safeguards
at inference time, where unsafe continuations may still arise. We propose
BRT-Align, a reachability-based framework that brings control-theoretic safety
tools to LLM inference. BRT-Align models autoregressive generation as a
dynamical system in latent space and learn a safety value function via backward
reachability, estimating the worst-case evolution of a trajectory. This enables
two complementary mechanisms: (1) a runtime monitor that forecasts unsafe
completions several tokens in advance, and (2) a least-restrictive steering
filter that minimally perturbs latent states to redirect generation away from
unsafe regions. Experiments across multiple LLMs and toxicity benchmarks
demonstrate that BRT-Align provides more accurate and earlier detection of
unsafe continuations than baselines. Moreover, for LLM safety alignment,
BRT-Align substantially reduces unsafe generations while preserving sentence
diversity and coherence. Qualitative results further highlight emergent
alignment properties: BRT-Align consistently produces responses that are less
violent, less profane, less offensive, and less politically biased. Together,
these findings demonstrate that reachability analysis provides a principled and
practical foundation for inference-time LLM safety.</div></details>

<div class="mono">Increasing deployment of large language models (LLMs) in real-world
applications raises significant safety concerns. Most existing safety research
focuses on evaluating LLM outputs or specific safety tasks, limiting their
ability to address broader, undefined risks. Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs)
facilitate interpretability research to clarify model behavior by explaining
single-meaning atomic features decomposed from entangled signals. jHowever,
prior applications on SAEs do not interpret features with fine-grained
safety-related concepts, thus inadequately addressing safety-critical
behaviors, such as generating toxic responses and violating safety regulations.
For rigorous safety analysis, we must extract a rich and diverse set of
safety-relevant features that effectively capture these high-risk behaviors,
yet face two challenges: identifying SAEs with the greatest potential for
generating safety concept-specific neurons, and the prohibitively high cost of
detailed feature explanation. In this paper, we propose Safe-SAIL, a framework
for interpreting SAE features within LLMs to advance mechanistic understanding
in safety domains. Our approach systematically identifies SAE with best
concept-specific interpretability, explains safety-related neurons, and
introduces efficient strategies to scale up the interpretation process. We will
release a comprehensive toolkit including SAE checkpoints and human-readable
neuron explanations, which supports empirical analysis of safety risks to
promote research on LLM safety.</div></details>

to perform complex tasks with no training updates. Prior work has established
strong correlations between the number of in-context examples provided and the
accuracy of the model&#x27;s predictions. In this paper, we seek to explain this
correlation by showing that ICL approximates a Bayesian learner. This
perspective gives rise to a novel Bayesian scaling law for ICL. In experiments
with \mbox{GPT-2} models of different sizes, our scaling law matches existing
scaling laws in accuracy while also offering interpretable terms for task
priors, learning efficiency, and per-example probabilities. To illustrate the
analytic power that such interpretable scaling laws provide, we report on
controlled synthetic dataset experiments designed to inform real-world studies
of safety alignment. In our experimental protocol, we use SFT or DPO to
suppress an unwanted existing model capability and then use ICL to try to bring
that capability back (many-shot jailbreaking). We then study ICL on real-world
instruction-tuned LLMs using capabilities benchmarks as well as a new many-shot
jailbreaking dataset. In all cases, Bayesian scaling laws accurately predict
the conditions under which ICL will cause suppressed behaviors to reemerge,
which sheds light on the ineffectiveness of post-training at increasing LLM

<div class="mono">Alignment in large language models (LLMs) is used to enforce guidelines such
as safety. Yet, alignment fails in the face of jailbreak attacks that modify
inputs to induce unsafe outputs. In this paper, we introduce and evaluate a new
technique for jailbreak attacks. We observe that alignment embeds a safety
classifier in the LLM responsible for deciding between refusal and compliance,
and seek to extract an approximation of this classifier: a surrogate
classifier. To this end, we build candidate classifiers from subsets of the
LLM. We first evaluate the degree to which candidate classifiers approximate
the LLM&#x27;s safety classifier in benign and adversarial settings. Then, we attack
the candidates and measure how well the resulting adversarial inputs transfer
to the LLM. Our evaluation shows that the best candidates achieve accurate
agreement (an F1 score above 80%) using as little as 20% of the model
architecture. Further, we find that attacks mounted on the surrogate
classifiers can be transferred to the LLM with high success. For example, a
surrogate using only 50% of the Llama 2 model achieved an attack success rate
(ASR) of 70% with half the memory footprint and runtime -- a substantial
improvement over attacking the LLM directly, where we only observed a 22% ASR.
These results show that extracting surrogate classifiers is an effective and
efficient means for modeling (and therein addressing) the vulnerability of

jailbreak Success Rates (SRs), increasing from 7\% (no refinements) to 62\%
after three refinement iterations, while maintaining a cost of 7.5\textcent~per

that outputs from additional refinement steps are consistently rated as more
malicious and technically superior. Moreover, manual code analysis reveals that
generated outputs execute with minimal modification, although optimal

<div class="mono">As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in high-stakes
settings, the risk of generating harmful or toxic content remains a central
challenge. Post-hoc alignment methods are brittle: once unsafe patterns are
learned during pretraining, they are hard to remove. In this work, we present a
data-centric pretraining framework that builds safety into the model from the
start. Our framework consists of four key steps: (i) Safety Filtering: building
a safety classifier to classify webdata into safe and unsafe categories; (ii)
Safety Rephrasing: we recontextualize unsafe webdata into safer narratives;
(iii) Native Refusal: we develop RefuseWeb and Moral Education pretraining
datasets that actively teach model to refuse on unsafe content and the moral
reasoning behind it, and (iv) Harmfulness-Tag annotated pretraining: we flag
unsafe content during pretraining using a special token, and use it to steer
model away from unsafe generations at inference. Our safety-pretrained models
reduce attack success rates from 38.8\% to 8.4\% on standard LLM safety
benchmarks with no performance degradation on general tasks.</div></details>

<div class="mono">With the development of Large Language Models (LLMs), numerous efforts have
revealed their vulnerabilities to jailbreak attacks. Although these studies
have driven the progress in LLMs&#x27; safety alignment, it remains unclear whether
LLMs have internalized authentic knowledge to deal with real-world crimes, or
are merely forced to simulate toxic language patterns. This ambiguity raises
concerns that jailbreak success is often attributable to a hallucination loop
between jailbroken LLM and judger LLM. By decoupling the use of jailbreak
techniques, we construct knowledge-intensive Q\&amp;A to investigate the misuse
threats of LLMs in terms of dangerous knowledge possession, harmful task
planning utility, and harmfulness judgment robustness. Experiments reveal a
mismatch between jailbreak success rates and harmful knowledge possession in
LLMs, and existing LLM-as-a-judge frameworks tend to anchor harmfulness
judgments on toxic language patterns. Our study reveals a gap between existing
LLM safety assessments and real-world threat potential.</div></details>

<div class="mono">Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly vulnerable to a sophisticated
form of adversarial prompting known as camouflaged jailbreaking. This method
embeds malicious intent within seemingly benign language to evade existing
safety mechanisms. Unlike overt attacks, these subtle prompts exploit
contextual ambiguity and the flexible nature of language, posing significant
challenges to current defense systems. This paper investigates the construction
and impact of camouflaged jailbreak prompts, emphasizing their deceptive
characteristics and the limitations of traditional keyword-based detection
methods. We introduce a novel benchmark dataset, Camouflaged Jailbreak Prompts,
containing 500 curated examples (400 harmful and 100 benign prompts) designed
to rigorously stress-test LLM safety protocols. In addition, we propose a
multi-faceted evaluation framework that measures harmfulness across seven
dimensions: Safety Awareness, Technical Feasibility, Implementation Safeguards,
Harmful Potential, Educational Value, Content Quality, and Compliance Score.
Our findings reveal a stark contrast in LLM behavior: while models demonstrate
high safety and content quality with benign inputs, they exhibit a significant
decline in performance and safety when confronted with camouflaged jailbreak
attempts. This disparity underscores a pervasive vulnerability, highlighting
the urgent need for more nuanced and adaptive security strategies to ensure the

fine-tuning attacks -- a few harmful data mixed in the fine-tuning dataset can
break the LLMs&#x27;s safety alignment. While several defenses have been proposed,
our evaluation shows that existing defenses fail \textit{when some specific
training hyper-parameters are chosen} -- a large learning rate or a large
number of training epochs in the fine-tuning stage can easily invalidate the
defense. To this end, we propose Antidote, a post-fine-tuning stage solution,
which remains \textbf{\textit{agnostic to the training hyper-parameters in the

harmful parameters, the harmful model can be recovered from the harmful

<div class="mono" style="margin-top:8px">安全对齐的大型语言模型（LLMs）易受到有害微调攻击——在微调数据集中混入少量有害数据会破坏LLMs的安全对齐。虽然提出了几种防御措施，但我们的评估显示，现有防御在选择某些特定训练超参数时失败——在微调阶段，较大的学习率或较多的训练轮次会轻易使防御失效。为此，我们提出了解药，一种后微调阶段的解决方案，它对微调阶段的训练超参数保持无关性。解药依赖于这样一种理念：通过去除有害参数，可以从有害行为中恢复有害模型，而不管这些有害参数在微调阶段是如何形成的。基于这一理念，我们在有害微调后引入了一次性剪枝阶段，以去除负责生成有害内容的有害权重。尽管其简单性令人尴尬，但实证结果表明，解药可以在保持下游任务准确性的同时降低有害评分。代码可在https://github.com/git-disl/Antidote获取。</div>

<div class="mono">The research addresses the vulnerability of safety-aligned Large Language Models (LLMs) to harmful fine-tuning attacks, where the inclusion of a small amount of harmful data can compromise their safety alignment. Previous methods have been ineffective under certain training hyper-parameters, such as high learning rates or extended training epochs, which can invalidate their defenses. The proposed approach, Antidote, offers a post-fine-tuning solution that is agnostic to these hyper-parameters, focusing on removing harmful parameters to recover the model from harmful behaviors. This methodology introduces a one-shot pruning stage to eliminate weights responsible for generating harmful content. Experimental results demonstrate that Antidote effectively reduces harmful scores while preserving accuracy on downstream tasks, supporting its intended goals.</div>

<div class="mono">Incorporating external context can significantly enhance the response quality
of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, real-world contexts often mix
relevant information with disproportionate inappropriate content, posing
reliability risks. How do LLMs process and prioritize mixed context? To study
this, we introduce the Poisoned Context Testbed, pairing queries with
real-world contexts containing relevant and inappropriate content. Inspired by
associative learning in animals, we adapt the Rescorla-Wagner (RW) model from
neuroscience to quantify how competing contextual signals influence LLM
outputs. Our adapted model reveals a consistent behavioral pattern: LLMs
exhibit a strong tendency to incorporate information that is less prevalent in
the context. This susceptibility is harmful in real-world settings, where small
amounts of inappropriate content can substantially degrade response quality.
Empirical evaluations on our testbed further confirm this vulnerability. To
tackle this, we introduce RW-Steering, a two-stage finetuning-based approach
that enables the model to internally identify and ignore inappropriate signals.
Unlike prior methods that rely on extensive supervision across diverse context
mixtures, RW-Steering generalizes robustly across varying proportions of
inappropriate content. Experiments show that our best fine-tuned model improves
response quality by 39.8% and reverses the undesirable behavior curve,
establishing RW-Steering as a robust, generalizable context engineering
solution for improving LLM safety in real-world use.</div></details>

<div class="mono">Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly attracting attention in various
applications. Nonetheless, there is a growing concern as some users attempt to
exploit these models for malicious purposes, including the synthesis of
controlled substances and the propagation of disinformation, a technique known
as &quot;Jailbreak.&quot; While some studies have achieved defenses against jailbreak
attacks by modifying output distributions or detecting harmful content, the
exact rationale still remains elusive. In this work, we present a novel
neuron-level interpretability method that focuses on the role of safety-related
knowledge neurons. Unlike existing approaches, our method projects the model&#x27;s
internal representation into a more consistent and interpretable vocabulary
space. We then show that adjusting the activation of safety-related neurons can
effectively control the model&#x27;s behavior with a mean ASR higher than 97%.
Building on this insight, we propose SafeTuning, a fine-tuning strategy that
reinforces safety-critical neurons to improve model robustness against
jailbreaks. SafeTuning consistently reduces attack success rates across
multiple LLMs and outperforms all four baseline defenses. These findings offer
a new perspective on understanding and defending against jailbreak attacks.</div></details>

<div class="mono">Safety alignment in Large Language Models (LLMs) often involves mediating
internal representations to refuse harmful requests. Recent research has
demonstrated that these safety mechanisms can be bypassed by ablating or
removing specific representational directions within the model. In this paper,
we propose the opposite approach: Rank-One Safety Injection (ROSI), a white-box
method that amplifies a model&#x27;s safety alignment by permanently steering its
activations toward the refusal-mediating subspace. ROSI operates as a simple,
fine-tuning-free rank-one weight modification applied to all residual stream
write matrices. The required safety direction can be computed from a small set
of harmful and harmless instruction pairs. We show that ROSI consistently
increases safety refusal rates - as evaluated by Llama Guard 3 - while
preserving the utility of the model on standard benchmarks such as MMLU,
HellaSwag, and Arc. Furthermore, we show that ROSI can also re-align
&#x27;uncensored&#x27; models by amplifying their own latent safety directions,
demonstrating its utility as an effective last-mile safety procedure. Our
results suggest that targeted, interpretable weight steering is a cheap and
potent mechanism to improve LLM safety, complementing more resource-intensive
fine-tuning paradigms.</div></details>

The results of safety and helpfulness evaluations vary significantly across

ignoring the underexplored attack surface of user-controlled response

state manipulation.In this paper, we present a systematic black-box security
analysis of prefill-level jailbreak attacks. We categorize these new attacks
and evaluate their effectiveness across fourteen language models. Our
experiments show that prefill-level attacks achieve high success rates, with
adaptive methods exceeding 99% on several models. Token-level probability
analysis reveals that these attacks work through initial-state manipulation by
changing the first-token probability from refusal to compliance.Furthermore, we
show that prefill-level jailbreak can act as effective enhancers, increasing
the success of existing prompt-level attacks by 10 to 15 percentage points. Our
evaluation of several defense strategies indicates that conventional content

<div class="mono">Intent detection, a core component of natural language understanding, has
considerably evolved as a crucial mechanism in safeguarding large language
models (LLMs). While prior work has applied intent detection to enhance LLMs&#x27;
moderation guardrails, showing a significant success against content-level
jailbreaks, the robustness of these intent-aware guardrails under malicious
manipulations remains under-explored. In this work, we investigate the
vulnerability of intent-aware guardrails and demonstrate that LLMs exhibit
implicit intent detection capabilities. We propose a two-stage intent-based
prompt-refinement framework, IntentPrompt, that first transforms harmful
inquiries into structured outlines and further reframes them into
declarative-style narratives by iteratively optimizing prompts via feedback
loops to enhance jailbreak success for red-teaming purposes. Extensive
experiments across four public benchmarks and various black-box LLMs indicate
that our framework consistently outperforms several cutting-edge jailbreak

<div class="mono">The research addresses the vulnerability of content moderation guardrails in large language models (LLMs), particularly focusing on intent detection, which is essential for natural language understanding. Previous methods have successfully applied intent detection to improve LLM moderation but have not thoroughly examined the robustness of these guardrails against malicious intent manipulations. This study introduces a novel two-stage intent-based prompt-refinement framework, IntentPrompt, which enhances the effectiveness of jailbreak attempts by transforming harmful inquiries into structured outlines and reframing them into declarative narratives through iterative prompt optimization. The methodology was tested across four public benchmarks and various black-box LLMs, demonstrating that the proposed framework outperforms existing jailbreak methods and can bypass advanced defenses, achieving attack success rates between 88.25% and 97.12%. These results underscore significant weaknesses in LLM safety mechanisms and highlight the increasing challenge posed by intent manipulation to content moderation efforts.</div>

<div class="mono">Jailbreak attacks pose a serious threat to the safety of Large Language
Models (LLMs) by crafting adversarial prompts that bypass alignment mechanisms,
causing the models to produce harmful, restricted, or biased content. In this
paper, we propose SafeLLM, a novel unlearning-based defense framework that
unlearn the harmful knowledge from LLMs while preserving linguistic fluency and
general capabilities. SafeLLM employs a three-stage pipeline: (1) dynamic
unsafe output detection using a hybrid approach that integrates external
classifiers with model-internal evaluations; (2) token-level harmful content
tracing through feedforward network (FFN) activations to localize harmful
knowledge; and (3) constrained optimization to suppress unsafe behavior without
degrading overall model quality. SafeLLM achieves targeted and irreversible
forgetting by identifying and neutralizing FFN substructures responsible for
harmful generation pathways. Extensive experiments on prominent LLMs (Vicuna,
LLaMA, and GPT-J) across multiple jailbreak benchmarks show that SafeLLM
substantially reduces attack success rates while maintaining high
general-purpose performance. Compared to standard defense methods such as
supervised fine-tuning and direct preference optimization, SafeLLM offers
stronger safety guarantees, more precise control over harmful behavior, and
greater robustness to unseen attacks. Moreover, SafeLLM maintains the general
performance after the harmful knowledge unlearned. These results highlight
unlearning as a promising direction for scalable and effective LLM safety.</div></details>

<div class="mono">Jailbreak attacks pose a serious challenge to the safe deployment of large
language models (LLMs). We introduce CCFC (Core &amp; Core-Full-Core), a
dual-track, prompt-level defense framework designed to mitigate LLMs&#x27;
vulnerabilities from prompt injection and structure-aware jailbreak attacks.
CCFC operates by first isolating the semantic core of a user query via few-shot
prompting, and then evaluating the query using two complementary tracks: a
core-only track to ignore adversarial distractions (e.g., toxic suffixes or
prefix injections), and a core-full-core (CFC) track to disrupt the structural
patterns exploited by gradient-based or edit-based attacks. The final response
is selected based on a safety consistency check across both tracks, ensuring
robustness without compromising on response quality. We demonstrate that CCFC
cuts attack success rates by 50-75% versus state-of-the-art defenses against
strong adversaries (e.g., DeepInception, GCG), without sacrificing fidelity on
benign queries. Our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
prompt-level defenses, offering a practical and effective solution for safer

<div class="mono">Prompt engineering is an effective but labor-intensive way to control
text-to-image (T2I) generative models. Its time-intensive nature and complexity
have spurred the development of algorithms for automated prompt generation.
However, these methods often struggle with transferability across T2I models,
require white-box access to the underlying model, or produce non-intuitive
prompts. In this work, we introduce PRISM, an algorithm that automatically
produces human-interpretable and transferable prompts that can effectively
generate desired concepts given only black-box access to T2I models. Inspired
by large language model (LLM) jailbreaking, PRISM leverages the in-context
learning ability of LLMs to iteratively refine the candidate prompt
distribution built upon the reference images. Our experiments demonstrate the
versatility and effectiveness of PRISM in generating accurate prompts for
objects, styles, and images across multiple T2I models, including Stable
Diffusion, DALL-E, and Midjourney.</div></details>

<div class="mono">Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly exhibit over-refusal - erroneously
rejecting benign queries due to overly conservative safety measures - a
critical functional flaw that undermines their reliability and usability.
Current methods for testing this behavior are demonstrably inadequate,
suffering from flawed benchmarks and limited test generation capabilities, as
highlighted by our empirical user study. To the best of our knowledge, this
paper introduces the first evolutionary testing framework, ORFuzz, for the
systematic detection and analysis of LLM over-refusals. ORFuzz uniquely
integrates three core components: (1) safety category-aware seed selection for
comprehensive test coverage, (2) adaptive mutator optimization using reasoning
LLMs to generate effective test cases, and (3) OR-Judge, a human-aligned judge
model validated to accurately reflect user perception of toxicity and refusal.
Our extensive evaluations demonstrate that ORFuzz generates diverse, validated
over-refusal instances at a rate (6.98% average) more than double that of
leading baselines, effectively uncovering vulnerabilities. Furthermore,
ORFuzz&#x27;s outputs form the basis of ORFuzzSet, a new benchmark of 1,855 highly
transferable test cases that achieves a superior 63.56% average over-refusal
rate across 10 diverse LLMs, significantly outperforming existing datasets.
ORFuzz and ORFuzzSet provide a robust automated testing framework and a

<div class="mono">The integration of LLMs into robots has witnessed significant growth, where
LLMs can convert instructions into executable robot policies. However, the
inherent vulnerability of LLMs to jailbreak attacks brings critical security
risks from the digital domain to the physical world. An attacked LLM-based
robot could execute harmful policies and cause physical harm. In this paper, we
investigate the feasibility and rationale of jailbreak attacks against
LLM-based robots and answer three research questions: (1) How applicable are
existing LLM jailbreak attacks against LLM-based robots? (2) What unique
challenges arise if they are not directly applicable? (3) How to defend against
such jailbreak attacks? To this end, we first construct a
&quot;human-object-environment&quot; robot risks-oriented Harmful-RLbench and then
conduct a measurement study on LLM-based robot systems. Our findings conclude
that traditional LLM jailbreak attacks are inapplicable in robot scenarios, and
we identify two unique challenges: determining policy-executable optimization
directions and accurately evaluating robot-jailbroken policies. To enable a
more thorough security analysis, we introduce POEX (POlicy EXecutable)
jailbreak, a red-teaming framework that induces harmful yet executable policy
to jailbreak LLM-based robots. POEX incorporates hidden layer gradient
optimization to guarantee jailbreak success and policy execution as well as a
multi-agent evaluator to accurately assess the practical executability of
policies. Experiments conducted on the real-world robotic systems and in
simulation demonstrate the efficacy of POEX, highlighting critical security
vulnerabilities and its transferability across LLMs. Finally, we propose
prompt-based and model-based defenses to mitigate attacks. Our findings
underscore the urgent need for security measures to ensure the safe deployment
of LLM-based robots in critical applications.</div></details>

<div class="mono">Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive fluency and
reasoning capabilities, but their potential for misuse has raised growing
concern. In this paper, we present ScamAgent, an autonomous multi-turn agent
built on top of LLMs, capable of generating highly realistic scam call scripts
that simulate real-world fraud scenarios. Unlike prior work focused on
single-shot prompt misuse, ScamAgent maintains dialogue memory, adapts
dynamically to simulated user responses, and employs deceptive persuasion
strategies across conversational turns. We show that current LLM safety
guardrails, including refusal mechanisms and content filters, are ineffective
against such agent-based threats. Even models with strong prompt-level
safeguards can be bypassed when prompts are decomposed, disguised, or delivered
incrementally within an agent framework. We further demonstrate the
transformation of scam scripts into lifelike voice calls using modern
text-to-speech systems, completing a fully automated scam pipeline. Our
findings highlight an urgent need for multi-turn safety auditing, agent-level
control frameworks, and new methods to detect and disrupt conversational
deception powered by generative AI.</div></details>
<details class="detail"><summary>Summary / 总结</summary>
<div class="mono">This research addresses the growing concern over the misuse of Large Language Models (LLMs) in generating realistic scam calls. Previous methods primarily focused on single-shot prompt misuse, which failed to account for the dynamic and multi-turn nature of conversations, leading to ineffective safety measures. The proposed ScamAgent improves upon these methods by maintaining dialogue memory and adapting to user responses, employing deceptive strategies throughout the conversation. The contribution of this paper lies in demonstrating the limitations of current LLM safety mechanisms against agent-based threats and showcasing the complete automation of scam calls through text-to-speech systems. The methodology involves creating an autonomous agent capable of simulating human-level scam interactions, revealing the urgent need for enhanced safety auditing and detection methods in conversational AI.</div>
<div class="mono" style="margin-top:8px">本研究关注大型语言模型（LLMs）在生成真实诈骗电话中的误用问题，强调现有主要集中在单次提示误用的方法的不足。提出的ScamAgent通过采用自主的多轮对话系统，保持记忆并适应用户响应，有效地在对话中利用欺骗策略，从而与现有方法不同。这种方法的动机明确，因为它揭示了当前LLM安全机制的局限性，这些机制可能被基于代理的威胁所规避。本文的贡献在于展示了诈骗脚本转化为真实语音电话的过程，从而完成了一个自动化的诈骗管道。该方法论展示了在多轮交互中增强安全措施的必要性，研究结果表明现有的安全防护措施不足，因此强调了针对生成AI驱动的对话欺骗的新检测和干扰方法的必要性。</div>

<details class="detail"><summary>Abstract</summary>
<div class="mono">As large language models (LLMs) are deployed globally, it is crucial that
their responses are calibrated across languages to accurately convey
uncertainty and limitations. Prior work shows that LLMs are linguistically
overconfident in English, leading users to overrely on confident generations.
However, the usage and interpretation of epistemic markers (e.g., &#x27;I think
it&#x27;s&#x27;) differs sharply across languages. Here, we study the risks of
multilingual linguistic (mis)calibration, overconfidence, and overreliance
across five languages to evaluate LLM safety in a global context. Our work
finds that overreliance risks are high across languages. We first analyze the
distribution of LLM-generated epistemic markers and observe that LLMs are
overconfident across languages, frequently generating strengtheners even as
part of incorrect responses. Model generations are, however, sensitive to
documented cross-linguistic variation in usage: for example, models generate
the most markers of uncertainty in Japanese and the most markers of certainty
in German and Mandarin. Next, we measure human reliance rates across languages,
finding that reliance behaviors differ cross-linguistically: for example,
participants are significantly more likely to discount expressions of
uncertainty in Japanese than in English (i.e., ignore their &#x27;hedging&#x27; function
and rely on generations that contain them). Taken together, these results
indicate a high risk of reliance on overconfident model generations across
languages. Our findings highlight the challenges of multilingual linguistic
calibration and stress the importance of culturally and linguistically
contextualized model safety evaluations.</div></details>
<details class="detail"><summary>Summary / 总结</summary>
<div class="mono">This research addresses the critical issue of how large language models (LLMs) convey uncertainty and limitations across different languages, as prior studies have shown that LLMs exhibit linguistic overconfidence, particularly in English, leading to user overreliance on their outputs. Previous methods have primarily focused on English, neglecting the cross-linguistic variations in the interpretation of epistemic markers, which can result in miscalibration and increased risks of overreliance. The proposed approach evaluates LLM safety in a multilingual context by analyzing the distribution of epistemic markers and measuring human reliance rates across five languages, revealing significant differences in how users interpret uncertainty. The study finds that LLMs are generally overconfident across languages, with varying degrees of uncertainty expressed in different linguistic contexts, and highlights the need for culturally and linguistically contextualized evaluations of model safety. The findings indicate a high risk of reliance on overconfident model generations, emphasizing the importance of addressing multilingual calibration issues to improve LLM safety globally.</div>
<div class="mono" style="margin-top:8px">本研究关注大型语言模型（LLMs）在不同语言中如何传达不确定性和局限性的问题，因为先前的研究表明，LLMs在英语中表现出过度自信，导致用户过度依赖。现有方法主要集中在英语上，忽视了在表述认知标记时存在的显著跨语言差异，这可能导致误校准和增加过度依赖的风险。提出的方法涉及对五种语言中LLM生成的响应进行全面分析，检查认知标记的分布并测量人类依赖率。研究发现，LLMs在各语言中普遍表现出过度自信，且在不确定性表达和解读上存在显著差异，揭示了对这些过度自信输出的高依赖风险。研究结果强调了对LLMs进行多语言校准的必要性，并倡导进行文化背景化的安全评估，以减轻这些风险。</div>

<div class="mono">Security alignment enables the Large Language Model (LLM) to gain the
protection against malicious queries, but various jailbreak attack methods
reveal the vulnerability of this security mechanism. Previous studies have
isolated LLM jailbreak attacks and defenses. We analyze the security protection
mechanism of the LLM, and propose a framework that combines attack and defense.
Our method is based on the linearly separable property of LLM intermediate
layer embedding, as well as the essence of jailbreak attack, which aims to
embed harmful problems and transfer them to the safe area. We utilize
generative adversarial network (GAN) to learn the security judgment boundary
inside the LLM to achieve efficient jailbreak attack and defense. The
experimental results indicate that our method achieves an average jailbreak
success rate of 88.85\% across three popular LLMs, while the defense success
rate on the state-of-the-art jailbreak dataset reaches an average of 84.17\%.
This not only validates the effectiveness of our approach but also sheds light
on the internal security mechanisms of LLMs, offering new insights for
enhancing model security The code and data are available at

<div class="mono">This paper addresses the challenge of generating adversarial image using a
diffusion model to deceive multimodal large language models (MLLMs) into
generating the targeted responses, while avoiding significant distortion of the
clean image. To address the above challenges, we propose an adversarial-guided
diffusion (AGD) approach for adversarial attack MLLMs. We introduce
adversarial-guided noise to ensure attack efficacy. A key observation in our
design is that, unlike most traditional adversarial attacks which embed
high-frequency perturbations directly into the clean image, AGD injects target
semantics into the noise component of the reverse diffusion. Since the added
noise in a diffusion model spans the entire frequency spectrum, the adversarial
signal embedded within it also inherits this full-spectrum property.
Importantly, during reverse diffusion, the adversarial image is formed as a
linear combination of the clean image and the noise. Thus, when applying
defenses such as a simple low-pass filtering, which act independently on each
component, the adversarial image within the noise component is less likely to
be suppressed, as it is not confined to the high-frequency band. This makes AGD
inherently robust to variety defenses. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our AGD outperforms state-of-the-art methods in attack performance as well as
in model robustness to some defenses.</div></details>

<div class="mono">Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities across a
wide range of tasks, yet their safety mechanisms remain susceptible to
adversarial attacks that exploit cognitive biases -- systematic deviations from
rational judgment. Unlike prior jailbreaking approaches focused on prompt
engineering or algorithmic manipulation, this work highlights the overlooked
power of multi-bias interactions in undermining LLM safeguards. We propose
CognitiveAttack, a novel red-teaming framework that systematically leverages
both individual and combined cognitive biases. By integrating supervised
fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, CognitiveAttack generates prompts that
embed optimized bias combinations, effectively bypassing safety protocols while
maintaining high attack success rates. Experimental results reveal significant
vulnerabilities across 30 diverse LLMs, particularly in open-source models.
CognitiveAttack achieves a substantially higher attack success rate compared to
the SOTA black-box method PAP (60.1% vs. 31.6%), exposing critical limitations
in current defense mechanisms. These findings highlight multi-bias interactions
as a powerful yet underexplored attack vector. This work introduces a novel

<div class="mono">Large Language Models (LLMs) have become indispensable in real-world
applications. However, their widespread adoption raises significant safety
concerns, particularly in responding to socially harmful questions. Despite
substantial efforts to improve model safety through alignment, aligned models
can still have their safety protections undermined by subsequent fine-tuning -
even when the additional training data appears benign. In this paper, we
empirically demonstrate that this vulnerability stems from the sensitivity of
safety-critical low-rank subspaces in LLM parameters to fine-tuning. Building
on this insight, we propose a novel training-free method, termed Low-Rank
Extrapolation (LoX), to enhance safety robustness by extrapolating the safety
subspace of an aligned LLM. Our experimental results confirm the effectiveness
of LoX, demonstrating significant improvements in robustness against both
benign and malicious fine-tuning attacks while preserving the model&#x27;s
adaptability to new tasks. For instance, LoX leads to 11% to 54% absolute
reductions in attack success rates (ASR) facing benign or malicious fine-tuning
attacks. By investigating the ASR landscape of parameters, we attribute the
success of LoX to that the extrapolation moves LLM parameters to a flatter
zone, thereby less sensitive to perturbations. The code is available at

<div class="mono">As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in high-risk
domains such as law, finance, and medicine, systematically evaluating their
domain-specific safety and compliance becomes critical. While prior work has
largely focused on improving LLM performance in these domains, it has often
neglected the evaluation of domain-specific safety risks. To bridge this gap,
we first define domain-specific safety principles for LLMs based on the AMA
Principles of Medical Ethics, the ABA Model Rules of Professional Conduct, and
the CFA Institute Code of Ethics. Building on this foundation, we introduce
Trident-Bench, a benchmark specifically targeting LLM safety in the legal,
financial, and medical domains. We evaluated 19 general-purpose and
domain-specialized models on Trident-Bench and show that it effectively reveals
key safety gaps -- strong generalist models (e.g., GPT, Gemini) can meet basic
expectations, whereas domain-specialized models often struggle with subtle
ethical nuances. This highlights an urgent need for finer-grained
domain-specific safety improvements. By introducing Trident-Bench, our work
provides one of the first systematic resources for studying LLM safety in law
and finance, and lays the groundwork for future research aimed at reducing the
safety risks of deploying LLMs in professionally regulated fields. Code and

This paper introduces Aymara AI, a programmatic platform for generating and
administering customized, policy-grounded safety evaluations. Aymara AI
transforms natural-language safety policies into adversarial prompts and scores
model responses using an AI-based rater validated against human judgments. We
demonstrate its capabilities through the Aymara LLM Risk and Responsibility
Matrix, which evaluates 20 commercially available LLMs across 10 real-world
safety domains. Results reveal wide performance disparities, with mean safety
scores ranging from 86.2% to 52.4%. While models performed well in
well-established safety domains such as Misinformation (mean = 95.7%), they
consistently failed in more complex or underspecified domains, notably Privacy
&amp; Impersonation (mean = 24.3%). Analyses of Variance confirmed that safety
scores differed significantly across both models and domains (p &lt; .05). These
findings underscore the inconsistent and context-dependent nature of LLM safety

<div class="mono">As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in critical
applications, the challenge of jailbreaking, where adversaries manipulate the
models to bypass safety mechanisms, has become a significant concern. This
paper presents a dynamic Stackelberg game framework to model the interactions
between attackers and defenders in the context of LLM jailbreaking. The
framework treats the prompt-response dynamics as a sequential extensive-form
game, where the defender, as the leader, commits to a strategy while
anticipating the attacker&#x27;s optimal responses. We propose a novel agentic AI
solution, the &quot;Purple Agent,&quot; which integrates adversarial exploration and
defensive strategies using Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRT). The Purple
Agent actively simulates potential attack trajectories and intervenes
proactively to prevent harmful outputs. This approach offers a principled
method for analyzing adversarial dynamics and provides a foundation for
mitigating the risk of jailbreaking.</div></details>

<div class="mono">Existing safety assurance research has primarily focused on training-phase
alignment to instill safe behaviors into LLMs. However, recent studies have
exposed these methods&#x27; susceptibility to diverse jailbreak attacks.
Concurrently, inference scaling has significantly advanced LLM reasoning
capabilities but remains unexplored in the context of safety assurance.
Addressing this gap, our work pioneers inference scaling for robust and
effective LLM safety against emerging threats. We reveal that conventional
inference scaling techniques, despite their success in reasoning tasks, perform
poorly in safety contexts, even falling short of basic approaches like
Best-of-N Sampling. We attribute this inefficiency to a newly identified
challenge, the exploration--efficiency dilemma, arising from the high
computational overhead associated with frequent process reward model (PRM)
evaluations. To overcome this dilemma, we propose SAFFRON, a novel inference
scaling paradigm tailored explicitly for safety assurance. Central to our
approach is the introduction of a multifurcation reward model (MRM) that
significantly reduces the required number of reward model evaluations. To
operationalize this paradigm, we further propose: (i) a partial supervision
training objective for MRM, (ii) a conservative exploration constraint to
prevent out-of-distribution explorations, and (iii) a Trie-based key--value
caching strategy that facilitates cache sharing across sequences during tree
search. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our method.
Additionally, we publicly release our trained multifurcation reward model
(Saffron-1) and the accompanying token-level safety reward dataset (Safety4M)
to accelerate future research in LLM safety. Our code, model, and data are
publicly available at https://github.com/q-rz/saffron , and our project

<div class="mono">Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across domains
such as healthcare, education, and cybersecurity. However, this openness also
introduces significant security risks, particularly through embedding space
poisoning, which is a subtle attack vector where adversaries manipulate the
internal semantic representations of input data to bypass safety alignment
mechanisms. While previous research has investigated universal perturbation
methods, the dynamics of LLM safety alignment at the embedding level remain
insufficiently understood. Consequently, more targeted and accurate adversarial
perturbation techniques, which pose significant threats, have not been
adequately studied.
  In this work, we propose ETTA (Embedding Transformation Toxicity
Attenuation), a novel framework that identifies and attenuates
toxicity-sensitive dimensions in embedding space via linear transformations.
ETTA bypasses model refusal behaviors while preserving linguistic coherence,
without requiring model fine-tuning or access to training data. Evaluated on
five representative open-source LLMs using the AdvBench benchmark, ETTA
achieves a high average attack success rate of 88.61%, outperforming the best
baseline by 11.34%, and generalizes to safety-enhanced models (e.g., 77.39% ASR
on instruction-tuned defenses). These results highlight a critical
vulnerability in current alignment strategies and underscore the need for
embedding-aware defenses.</div></details>

<div class="mono">As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly deployed, understanding
the complexity and evolution of jailbreaking strategies is critical for AI
safety.
  We present a mass-scale empirical analysis of jailbreak complexity across
over 2 million real-world conversations from diverse platforms, including
dedicated jailbreaking communities and general-purpose chatbots. Using a range
of complexity metrics spanning probabilistic measures, lexical diversity,
compression ratios, and cognitive load indicators, we find that jailbreak
attempts do not exhibit significantly higher complexity than normal
conversations. This pattern holds consistently across specialized jailbreaking
communities and general user populations, suggesting practical bounds on attack
sophistication. Temporal analysis reveals that while user attack toxicity and
complexity remains stable over time, assistant response toxicity has decreased,
indicating improving safety mechanisms. The absence of power-law scaling in
complexity distributions further points to natural limits on jailbreak
development.
  Our findings challenge the prevailing narrative of an escalating arms race
between attackers and defenders, instead suggesting that LLM safety evolution
is bounded by human ingenuity constraints while defensive measures continue
advancing. Our results highlight critical information hazards in academic
jailbreak disclosure, as sophisticated attacks exceeding current complexity
baselines could disrupt the observed equilibrium and enable widespread harm
before defensive adaptation.</div></details>

<div class="mono">Despite the remarkable performance of Large Language Models (LLMs), they
remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, which can compromise their safety
mechanisms. Existing studies often rely on brute-force optimization or manual
design, failing to uncover potential risks in real-world scenarios. To address
this, we propose a novel jailbreak attack framework, ICRT, inspired by
heuristics and biases in human cognition. Leveraging the simplicity effect, we
employ cognitive decomposition to reduce the complexity of malicious prompts.
Simultaneously, relevance bias is utilized to reorganize prompts, enhancing
semantic alignment and inducing harmful outputs effectively. Furthermore, we
introduce a ranking-based harmfulness evaluation metric that surpasses the
traditional binary success-or-failure paradigm by employing ranking aggregation
methods such as Elo, HodgeRank, and Rank Centrality to comprehensively quantify
the harmfulness of generated content. Experimental results show that our
approach consistently bypasses mainstream LLMs&#x27; safety mechanisms and generates

<div class="mono">As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly deployed in
safety-critical applications, the lack of systematic methods to assess their
vulnerability to jailbreak attacks presents a critical security gap. We
introduce the jailbreak oracle problem: given a model, prompt, and decoding
strategy, determine whether a jailbreak response can be generated with
likelihood exceeding a specified threshold. This formalization enables a
principled study of jailbreak vulnerabilities. Answering the jailbreak oracle
problem poses significant computational challenges -- the search space grows
exponentially with the length of the response tokens. We present Boa, the first
efficient algorithm for solving the jailbreak oracle problem. Boa employs a
three-phase search strategy: (1) constructing block lists to identify refusal

and (3) depth-first priority search guided by fine-grained safety scores to
systematically explore promising low-probability paths. Boa enables rigorous
security assessments including systematic defense evaluation, standardized

emergenece of model context protocol (MCP), which defines the standard on how
should a LLM interact with external services, such as \api and data. However,
as MCP becomes the de facto standard for LLM agent systems, it also introduces
new safety risks. In particular, MCP introduces third-party services, which are
not controlled by the LLM developers, into the agent systems. These third-party
MCP services provider are potentially malicious and have the economic
incentives to exploit vulnerabilities and sabotage user-agent interactions. In
this position paper, we advocate the research community in LLM safety to pay
close attention to the new safety risks issues introduced by MCP, and develop
new techniques to build safe MCP-powered agent systems. To establish our
position, we argue with three key parts. (1) We first construct \framework, a
controlled framework to examine safety issues in MCP-powered agent systems. (2)
We then conduct a series of pilot experiments to demonstrate the safety risks
in MCP-powered agent systems is a real threat and its defense is not trivial.
(3) Finally, we give our outlook by showing a roadmap to build safe MCP-powered
agent systems. In particular, we would call for researchers to persue the
following research directions: red teaming, MCP safe LLM development, MCP
safety evaluation, MCP safety data accumulation, MCP service safeguard, and MCP
safe ecosystem construction. We hope this position paper can raise the
awareness of the research community in MCP safety and encourage more
researchers to join this important research direction. Our code is available at

<div class="mono" style="margin-top:8px">大型语言模型（LLMs）的发展已进入一个以经验为驱动的时代，标志着通过强化学习和工具使用代理的环境反馈驱动学习的出现。这促进了模型上下文协议（MCP）的出现，该协议定义了LLM与外部服务（如API和数据）交互的标准。然而，随着MCP成为LLM代理系统的事实标准，它也引入了新的安全风险。特别是，MCP将不受LLM开发者控制的第三方服务引入代理系统。这些第三方MCP服务提供商可能是恶意的，并且有经济动机利用漏洞和破坏用户与代理的交互。在这篇立场论文中，我们呼吁LLM安全研究社区密切关注MCP引入的新安全风险问题，并开发新技术以构建安全的MCP驱动代理系统。为了确立我们的立场，我们通过三个关键部分进行论证。(1) 我们首先构建了一个受控框架，以检查MCP驱动代理系统中的安全问题。(2) 然后，我们进行了一系列试点实验，以证明MCP驱动代理系统中的安全风险是真实威胁，其防御并非易事。(3) 最后，我们通过展示构建安全MCP驱动代理系统的路线图来展望未来。特别是，我们呼吁研究人员追求以下研究方向：红队测试、MCP安全LLM开发、MCP安全评估、MCP安全数据积累、MCP服务保障和MCP安全生态系统建设。我们希望这篇立场论文能够提高研究社区对MCP安全的关注，并鼓励更多研究人员加入这一重要研究方向。我们的代码可在https://github.com/littlelittlenine/SafeMCP.git获取。</div>

<div class="mono">Current LLM safety defenses fail under decomposition attacks, where a
malicious goal is decomposed into benign subtasks that circumvent refusals. The
challenge lies in the existing shallow safety alignment techniques: they only
detect harm in the immediate prompt and do not reason about long-range intent,
leaving them blind to malicious intent that emerges over a sequence of
seemingly benign instructions. We therefore propose adding an external monitor
that observes the conversation at a higher granularity. To facilitate our study
of monitoring decomposition attacks, we curate the largest and most diverse
dataset to date, including question-answering, text-to-image, and agentic
tasks. We verify our datasets by testing them on frontier LLMs and show an 87%
attack success rate on average on GPT-4o. This confirms that decomposition
attack is broadly effective. Additionally, we find that random tasks can be
injected into the decomposed subtasks to further obfuscate malicious intents.
To defend in real time, we propose a lightweight sequential monitoring
framework that cumulatively evaluates each subtask. We show that a carefully
prompt engineered lightweight monitor achieves a 93% defense success rate,
beating reasoning models like o3 mini as a monitor. Moreover, it remains robust
against random task injection and cuts cost by 90% and latency by 50%. Our
findings suggest that lightweight sequential monitors are highly effective in
mitigating decomposition attacks and are viable in deployment.</div></details>

<div class="mono">As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly prevalent, ensuring their
robustness against adversarial misuse is crucial. This paper introduces the GAP
(Graph of Attacks with Pruning) framework, an advanced approach for generating
stealthy jailbreak prompts to evaluate and enhance LLM safeguards. GAP
addresses limitations in existing tree-based LLM jailbreak methods by
implementing an interconnected graph structure that enables knowledge sharing
across attack paths. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates GAP&#x27;s superiority
over existing techniques, achieving a 20.8% increase in attack success rates
while reducing query costs by 62.7%. GAP consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art methods for attacking both open and closed LLMs, with attack
success rates of &gt;96%. Additionally, we present specialized variants like
GAP-Auto for automated seed generation and GAP-VLM for multimodal attacks.

<div class="mono">Large Language Models (LLMs) have showcased remarkable capabilities across
various domains. Accompanying the evolving capabilities and expanding
deployment scenarios of LLMs, their deployment challenges escalate due to their
sheer scale and the advanced yet complex activation designs prevalent in
notable model series, such as Llama, Gemma, Mistral. These challenges have
become particularly pronounced in resource-constrained deployment scenarios,
where mitigating inference bottlenecks is imperative. Among various recent
efforts, activation approximation has emerged as a promising avenue for
pursuing inference efficiency, sometimes considered indispensable in
applications such as private inference. Despite achieving substantial speedups
with minimal impact on utility, even appearing sound and practical for
real-world deployment, the safety implications of activation approximations
remain unclear. In this work, we fill this critical gap in LLM safety by
conducting the first systematic safety evaluation of activation approximations.
Our safety vetting spans seven state-of-the-art techniques across three popular
categories (activation polynomialization, activation sparsification, and
activation quantization), revealing consistent safety degradation across ten
safety-aligned LLMs. To overcome the hurdle of devising a unified defense
accounting for diverse activation approximation methods, we perform an in-depth
analysis of their shared error patterns and uncover three key findings. We
propose QuadA, a novel safety enhancement method tailored to mitigate the
safety compromises introduced by activation approximations. Extensive
experiments and ablation studies corroborate QuadA&#x27;s effectiveness in enhancing
the safety capabilities of LLMs after activation approximations.</div></details>

<div class="mono">Large language models (LLMs) have made significant advancements across
various tasks, but their safety alignment remain a major concern. Exploring
jailbreak prompts can expose LLMs&#x27; vulnerabilities and guide efforts to secure
them. Existing methods primarily design sophisticated instructions for the LLM
to follow, or rely on multiple iterations, which could hinder the performance
and efficiency of jailbreaks. In this work, we propose a novel jailbreak
paradigm, Simple Assistive Task Linkage (SATA), which can effectively
circumvent LLM safeguards and elicit harmful responses. Specifically, SATA
first masks harmful keywords within a malicious query to generate a relatively
benign query containing one or multiple [MASK] special tokens. It then employs
a simple assistive task such as a masked language model task or an element
lookup by position task to encode the semantics of the masked keywords.
Finally, SATA links the assistive task with the masked query to jointly perform
the jailbreak. Extensive experiments show that SATA achieves state-of-the-art
performance and outperforms baselines by a large margin. Specifically, on
AdvBench dataset, with mask language model (MLM) assistive task, SATA achieves
an overall attack success rate (ASR) of 85% and harmful score (HS) of 4.57, and
with element lookup by position (ELP) assistive task, SATA attains an overall
ASR of 76% and HS of 4.43.</div></details>

<div class="mono">Machine learning is advancing rapidly, with applications bringing notable
benefits, such as improvements in translation and code generation. Models like
ChatGPT, powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), are increasingly integrated
into daily life. However, alongside these benefits, LLMs also introduce social
risks. Malicious users can exploit LLMs by submitting harmful prompts, such as
requesting instructions for illegal activities. To mitigate this, models often
include a security mechanism that automatically rejects such harmful prompts.
However, they can be bypassed through LLM jailbreaks. Current jailbreaks often
require significant manual effort, high computational costs, or result in
excessive model modifications that may degrade regular utility.
  We introduce TwinBreak, an innovative safety alignment removal method.
Building on the idea that the safety mechanism operates like an embedded
backdoor, TwinBreak identifies and prunes parameters responsible for this
functionality. By focusing on the most relevant model layers, TwinBreak
performs fine-grained analysis of parameters essential to model utility and
safety. TwinBreak is the first method to analyze intermediate outputs from
prompts with high structural and content similarity to isolate safety
parameters. We present the TwinPrompt dataset containing 100 such twin prompts.

<div class="mono">With the growing deployment of LLMs in daily applications like chatbots and
content generation, efforts to ensure outputs align with human values and avoid
harmful content have intensified. However, increasingly sophisticated jailbreak
attacks threaten this alignment, aiming to induce unsafe outputs. Current
defense efforts either focus on prompt rewriting or detection, which are
limited in effectiveness due to the various design of jailbreak prompts, or on
output control and detection, which are computationally expensive as they
require LLM inference. Therefore, designing a pre-inference defense method that
resists diverse jailbreak prompts is crucial for preventing LLM jailbreak
attacks. We observe that jailbreak attacks, safe queries, and harmful queries
exhibit different clustering patterns within the LLM&#x27;s hidden state
representation space. This suggests that by leveraging the LLM&#x27;s hidden state
representational capabilities, we can analyze the LLM&#x27;s forthcoming behavior
and proactively intervene for defense. In this paper, we propose a jailbreak
attack defense strategy based on a Hidden State Filter (HSF), a lossless
architectural defense mechanism that enables the model to preemptively identify
and reject adversarial inputs before the inference process begins. We activate
its defensive potential through an additional plugin module, effectively
framing the defense task as a classification problem. Experimental results on
two benchmark datasets, utilizing three different LLMs, show that HSF
significantly enhances resilience against six cutting-edge jailbreak attacks.
It significantly reduces the success rate of jailbreak attacks while minimally
impacting responses to benign user queries, with negligible inference overhead,
and outperforming defense baselines.Our code and data are available at

<div class="mono" style="margin-top:8px">随着大型语言模型（LLMs）在聊天机器人和内容生成等日常应用中的广泛部署，确保输出与人类价值观一致并避免有害内容的努力加剧。然而，日益复杂的越狱攻击威胁着这种一致性，旨在诱导不安全的输出。目前的防御工作要么集中在提示重写或检测上，由于越狱提示的多样设计而效果有限，要么集中在输出控制和检测上，这在计算上代价高昂，因为它们需要LLM推理。因此，设计一种抵御多样越狱提示的推理前防御方法对于防止LLM越狱攻击至关重要。我们观察到越狱攻击、安全查询和有害查询在LLM的隐藏状态表示空间中表现出不同的聚类模式。这表明，通过利用LLM的隐藏状态表示能力，我们可以分析LLM即将出现的行为并主动进行防御干预。在本文中，我们提出了一种基于隐藏状态过滤器（HSF）的越狱攻击防御策略，这是一种无损的架构防御机制，使模型能够在推理过程开始之前主动识别和拒绝对抗输入。我们通过一个额外的插件模块激活其防御潜力，有效地将防御任务框定为分类问题。在两个基准数据集上的实验结果，利用三种不同的LLM，表明HSF显著增强了对六种前沿越狱攻击的抵抗力。它显著降低了越狱攻击的成功率，同时对良性用户查询的响应影响最小，推理开销微乎其微，并且优于防御基线。我们的代码和数据可在https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Hidden-State-Filtering-8652/获取。</div>

<div class="mono">The remarkable success of Large Language Models (LLMs) has illuminated a
promising pathway toward achieving Artificial General Intelligence for both
academic and industrial communities, owing to their unprecedented performance
across various applications. As LLMs continue to gain prominence in both
research and commercial domains, their security and safety implications have
become a growing concern, not only for researchers and corporations but also
for every nation. Currently, existing surveys on LLM safety primarily focus on
specific stages of the LLM lifecycle, e.g., deployment phase or fine-tuning
phase, lacking a comprehensive understanding of the entire &quot;lifechain&quot; of LLMs.
To address this gap, this paper introduces, for the first time, the concept of
&quot;full-stack&quot; safety to systematically consider safety issues throughout the
entire process of LLM training, deployment, and eventual commercialization.
Compared to the off-the-shelf LLM safety surveys, our work demonstrates several
distinctive advantages: (I) Comprehensive Perspective. We define the complete
LLM lifecycle as encompassing data preparation, pre-training, post-training,
deployment and final commercialization. To our knowledge, this represents the
first safety survey to encompass the entire lifecycle of LLMs. (II) Extensive
Literature Support. Our research is grounded in an exhaustive review of over
800+ papers, ensuring comprehensive coverage and systematic organization of
security issues within a more holistic understanding. (III) Unique Insights.
Through systematic literature analysis, we have developed reliable roadmaps and
perspectives for each chapter. Our work identifies promising research
directions, including safety in data generation, alignment techniques, model
editing, and LLM-based agent systems. These insights provide valuable guidance
for researchers pursuing future work in this field.</div></details>

<div class="mono">Large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly applied to various
domains, which triggers increasing concerns about LLMs&#x27; safety on specialized
domains, e.g. medicine. Despite prior explorations on general jailbreaking
attacks, there are two challenges for applying existing attacks on testing the
domain-specific safety of LLMs: (1) Lack of professional knowledge-driven
attacks, (2) Insufficient coverage of domain knowledge. To bridge this gap, we
propose a new task, knowledge-to-jailbreak, which aims to generate jailbreaking
attacks from domain knowledge, requiring both attack effectiveness and
knowledge relevance. We collect a large-scale dataset with 12,974
knowledge-jailbreak pairs and fine-tune a large language model as
jailbreak-generator, to produce domain knowledge-specific jailbreaks.
Experiments on 13 domains and 8 target LLMs demonstrate the effectiveness of
jailbreak-generator in generating jailbreaks that are both threatening to the
target LLMs and relevant to the given knowledge. We also apply our method to an
out-of-domain knowledge base, showing that jailbreak-generator can generate
jailbreaks that are comparable in harmfulness to those crafted by human
experts. Data and code are available at:

<div class="mono">Ensuring safety of large language models (LLMs) is important. Red teaming--a
systematic approach to identifying adversarial prompts that elicit harmful
responses from target LLMs--has emerged as a crucial safety evaluation method.
Within this framework, the diversity of adversarial prompts is essential for
comprehensive safety assessments. We find that previous approaches to
red-teaming may suffer from two key limitations. First, they often pursue
diversity through simplistic metrics like word frequency or sentence embedding
similarity, which may not capture meaningful variation in attack strategies.
Second, the common practice of training a single attacker model restricts
coverage across potential attack styles and risk categories. This paper
introduces Quality-Diversity Red-Teaming (QDRT), a new framework designed to
address these limitations. QDRT achieves goal-driven diversity through
behavior-conditioned training and implements a behavioral replay buffer in an
open-ended manner. Additionally, it trains multiple specialized attackers
capable of generating high-quality attacks across diverse styles and risk
categories. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that QDRT generates attacks
that are both more diverse and more effective against a wide range of target
LLMs, including GPT-2, Llama-3, Gemma-2, and Qwen2.5. This work advances the
field of LLM safety by providing a systematic and effective approach to
automated red-teaming, ultimately supporting the responsible deployment of
LLMs.</div></details>

<div class="mono">As LLMs are increasingly deployed in real-world applications, ensuring their
ability to refuse malicious prompts, especially jailbreak attacks, is essential
for safe and reliable use. Recently, activation steering has emerged as an
effective approach for enhancing LLM safety by adding a refusal direction
vector to internal activations of LLMs during inference, which will further
induce the refusal behaviors of LLMs. However, indiscriminately applying
activation steering fundamentally suffers from the trade-off between safety and
utility, since the same steering vector can also lead to over-refusal and
degraded performance on benign prompts. Although prior efforts, such as vector
calibration and conditional steering, have attempted to mitigate this
trade-off, their lack of theoretical grounding limits their robustness and
effectiveness. To better address the trade-off between safety and utility, we
present a theoretically grounded and empirically effective activation steering
method called AlphaSteer. Specifically, it considers activation steering as a
learnable process with two principled learning objectives: utility preservation
and safety enhancement. For utility preservation, it learns to construct a
nearly zero vector for steering benign data, with the null-space constraints.
For safety enhancement, it learns to construct a refusal direction vector for
steering malicious data, with the help of linear regression. Experiments across
multiple jailbreak attacks and utility benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness
of AlphaSteer, which significantly improves the safety of LLMs without
compromising general capabilities. Our codes are available at

<div class="mono">Ensuring and improving the safety of autonomous driving systems (ADS) is
crucial for the deployment of highly automated vehicles, especially in
safety-critical events. To address the rarity issue, adversarial scenario
generation methods are developed, in which behaviors of traffic participants
are manipulated to induce safety-critical events. However, existing methods
still face two limitations. First, identification of the adversarial
participant directly impacts the effectiveness of the generation. However, the
complexity of real-world scenarios, with numerous participants and diverse
behaviors, makes identification challenging. Second, the potential of generated
safety-critical scenarios to continuously improve ADS performance remains
underexplored. To address these issues, we propose LLM-attacker: a closed-loop
adversarial scenario generation framework leveraging large language models
(LLMs). Specifically, multiple LLM agents are designed and coordinated to
identify optimal attackers. Then, the trajectories of the attackers are
optimized to generate adversarial scenarios. These scenarios are iteratively
refined based on the performance of ADS, forming a feedback loop to improve
ADS. Experimental results show that LLM-attacker can create more dangerous
scenarios than other methods, and the ADS trained with it achieves a collision
rate half that of training with normal scenarios. This indicates the ability of
LLM-attacker to test and enhance the safety and robustness of ADS. Video

<div class="mono">Safely aligning large language models (LLMs) often demands extensive
human-labeled preference data, a process that&#x27;s both costly and time-consuming.
While synthetic data offers a promising alternative, current methods frequently
rely on complex iterative prompting or auxiliary models. To address this, we
introduce Refusal-Aware Adaptive Injection (RAAI), a straightforward,
training-free, and model-agnostic framework that repurposes LLM attack
techniques. RAAI works by detecting internal refusal signals and adaptively
injecting predefined phrases to elicit harmful, yet fluent, completions. Our
experiments show RAAI effectively jailbreaks LLMs, increasing the harmful
response rate from a baseline of 2.15% to up to 61.04% on average across four
benchmarks. Crucially, fine-tuning LLMs with the synthetic data generated by
RAAI improves model robustness against harmful prompts while preserving general
capabilities on standard tasks like MMLU and ARC. This work highlights how LLM
attack methodologies can be reframed as practical tools for scalable and
controllable safety alignment.</div></details>

<div class="mono">Current LLM pipelines account for only one possible tokenization for a given
string, ignoring exponentially many alternative tokenizations during training
and inference. For example, the standard Llama3 tokenization of penguin is
[p,enguin], yet [peng,uin] is another perfectly valid alternative. In this
paper, we show that despite LLMs being trained solely on one tokenization, they
still retain semantic understanding of other tokenizations, raising questions
about their implications in LLM safety. Put succinctly, we answer the following
question: can we adversarially tokenize an obviously malicious string to evade
safety and alignment restrictions? We show that not only is adversarial
tokenization an effective yet previously neglected axis of attack, but it is
also competitive against existing state-of-the-art adversarial approaches
without changing the text of the harmful request. We empirically validate this
exploit across three state-of-the-art LLMs and adversarial datasets, revealing
a previously unknown vulnerability in subword models.</div></details>

<details class="detail"><summary>Abstract</summary>
<div class="mono">Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have underscored their
vulnerability to safety alignment jailbreaks, particularly when subjected to
downstream fine-tuning. However, existing mitigation strategies primarily focus
on reactively addressing jailbreak incidents after safety guardrails have been
compromised, removing harmful gradients during fine-tuning, or continuously
reinforcing safety alignment throughout fine-tuning. As such, they tend to
overlook a critical upstream factor: the role of the original safety-alignment
data. This paper therefore investigates the degradation of safety guardrails
through the lens of representation similarity between upstream alignment
datasets and downstream fine-tuning tasks. Our experiments demonstrate that
high similarity between these datasets significantly weakens safety guardrails,
making models more susceptible to jailbreaks. Conversely, low similarity
between these two types of datasets yields substantially more robust models and
thus reduces harmfulness score by up to 10.33%. By highlighting the importance
of upstream dataset design in the building of durable safety guardrails and
reducing real-world vulnerability to jailbreak attacks, these findings offer
actionable insights for fine-tuning service providers.</div></details>

<div class="mono">The emergence of vision-language-action models (VLAs) for end-to-end control
is reshaping the field of robotics by enabling the fusion of multimodal sensory
inputs at the billion-parameter scale. The capabilities of VLAs stem primarily
from their architectures, which are often based on frontier large language
models (LLMs). However, LLMs are known to be susceptible to adversarial misuse,
and given the significant physical risks inherent to robotics, questions remain
regarding the extent to which VLAs inherit these vulnerabilities. Motivated by
these concerns, in this work we initiate the study of adversarial attacks on
VLA-controlled robots. Our main algorithmic contribution is the adaptation and
application of LLM jailbreaking attacks to obtain complete control authority
over VLAs. We find that textual attacks, which are applied once at the
beginning of a rollout, facilitate full reachability of the action space of
commonly used VLAs and often persist over longer horizons. This differs
significantly from LLM jailbreaking literature, as attacks in the real world do
not have to be semantically linked to notions of harm. We make all code

<div class="mono">The safety alignment of large language models (LLMs) remains vulnerable, as
their initial behavior can be easily jailbroken by even relatively simple
attacks. Since infilling a fixed template between the input instruction and
initial model output is a common practice for existing LLMs, we hypothesize
that this template is a key factor behind their vulnerabilities: LLMs&#x27;
safety-related decision-making overly relies on the aggregated information from
the template region, which largely influences these models&#x27; safety behavior. We
refer to this issue as template-anchored safety alignment. In this paper, we
conduct extensive experiments and verify that template-anchored safety
alignment is widespread across various aligned LLMs. Our mechanistic analyses
demonstrate how it leads to models&#x27; susceptibility when encountering
inference-time jailbreak attacks. Furthermore, we show that detaching safety
mechanisms from the template region is promising in mitigating vulnerabilities
to jailbreak attacks. We encourage future research to develop more robust
safety alignment techniques that reduce reliance on the template region.</div></details>

<div class="mono">Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have significantly advanced beyond traditional
Large Language Models (LLMs) with their exceptional logical reasoning
capabilities, yet these improvements introduce heightened safety risks. When
subjected to jailbreak attacks, their ability to generate more targeted and
organized content can lead to greater harm. Although some studies claim that
reasoning enables safer LRMs against existing LLM attacks, they overlook the
inherent flaws within the reasoning process itself. To address this gap, we
propose the first jailbreak attack targeting LRMs, exploiting their unique
vulnerabilities stemming from the advanced reasoning capabilities.
Specifically, we introduce a Chaos Machine, a novel component to transform
attack prompts with diverse one-to-one mappings. The chaos mappings iteratively
generated by the machine are embedded into the reasoning chain, which
strengthens the variability and complexity and also promotes a more robust
attack. Based on this, we construct the Mousetrap framework, which makes
attacks projected into nonlinear-like low sample spaces with mismatched
generalization enhanced. Also, due to the more competing objectives, LRMs
gradually maintain the inertia of unpredictable iterative reasoning and fall
into our trap. Success rates of the Mousetrap attacking o1-mini, Claude-Sonnet
and Gemini-Thinking are as high as 96%, 86% and 98% respectively on our toxic
dataset Trotter. On benchmarks such as AdvBench, StrongREJECT, and HarmBench,
attacking Claude-Sonnet, well-known for its safety, Mousetrap can astonishingly
achieve success rates of 87.5%, 86.58% and 93.13% respectively. Attention: This
